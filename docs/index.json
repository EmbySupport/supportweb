    "keywords": "3D Video Naming There are multiple ways to identify a video as 3D. Identify using the web interface A video can be identified as 3D using the the metadata manager . Simply edit a video: Then select the 3D format: Identify using video file name flags In order to properly detect 3D, two tags need to be present in the filename. First, a '3D' tag has to be present. Second, one of the following must also be present, hsbs, fsbs, sbs, htab, ftab, or mvc. Tags need be be surrounded be either a space ( ), hyphen -, dot . or underscore _. Tags are case-insensitive, so both 3d and 3D will work. Examples: moviename (year).3d.hsbs.mkv moviename (year) 3d sbs.mkv moviename (year).3D-HTAB.mkv moviename (year)-3D.sbs-720p.mkv moviename (year)-3D.mvc.mkv Identify using older conventions Older file naming conventions are still accepted by placing one of the following tags within the filename: [fsbs] [ftab] [hsbs] [htab] [3d] - Indicates half side by side [sbs3d] - Indicates half side by side For example: /Movies /300 (2006) 300 (2006) [hsbs].mkv /Home Alone (1990) Home Alone (1990) [fsbs].mkv Multiple Versions 3D can even be combined with the multi-version video support discussed in the Movie Naming article. Here's an example of a movie containing multiple versions in a single movie folder, some 3D and others 2D: /Movies /300 (2006) /300 (2006) - 1080p.mkv /300 (2006) - 720p.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d-hsbs.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d.hsbs.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d.mvc.mp4 Note There is a limit on the number of different versions for a media item. Up to 8 different versions will appear in any list of media item versions."

If you have multiple admins setup on your system you can have another admin account reset your password just as they would any other user. If this is the only admin account on the system this will be the method used to reset the master password follow these instructions. You will need access to the file system of the server itself as a special file is written with instructions. This prevents a 3rd party from gaining access to your Emby Setup as only the admin of the system should have access to this. From a web browser open your local server address which could be http://localhost:8096 but do NOT use Emby Connect. From the above choices click on the Forget Password choice. Fill in the account name you use to login to Emby with. In the following the account used is \"admin\". Click the Submit button after entering your admin account name. You will now get a popup message that includes the location to a file on the system you will need to open. The contents of the file will be different but similar to this: All that's needed for you to do now is open the new URL, enter the 4 digit code and then follow the prompts to reset your password. It's a rather simple process but requires access to the file system to make sure only privileged users can perform the reset."

Please see https://emby.media/support/articles/advisory-23-05.html for more information on how to proceed. For your safety we have shutdown your Emby Server as a precautionary measure Note: Your server was never directly accessed by us. We used our standard update mechanism On Windows installs, you encounter an error entry in the Windows event log, Source=\".NET Runtime\", EventId=1025 with the same text as above in the event details Background Starting Mid-May 2023, a hacker managed to infiltrate private user-hosted instances of Emby Server which were accessible via public internet and had an insecure configuration for administrative user accounts. Combined with the \"Proxy Header Vulnerability\", which was recently fixed in the beta channel, this allowed an attacker to gain administrative access on such systems. Eventually, this allowed the attackers to install a custom plugin of their own, which establishes a backdoor in the running process of Emby Server. After careful analysis and evaluation of possible strategies for mitigation, the Emby team was able to push out an update to Emby Server instances which is able to detect the plugin in question and prevents it from being loaded. Due to the severity and the nature of this situation and in an abundance of caution we are preventing affected servers to start up again after the detection. As the given situation requires direct action and assessment by the administrator, we determined that shutting down the server and preventing further startup up is the most suitable action as it disables the plug-in, possibly prevents the situation from getting worse and at the same time draws the attention of the administrator onto the subject. Analysis of the plug-in has revealed that it is forwarding the private Emby Server login credentials including the password for every successful login to an external server under control of the hackers. Actions to Take Add an entry to your server machine etc/hosts file: emmm.spxaebjhxtmddsri.xyz 127.0.0.1 This is the host name of the control server which the malware is communicating with For help on this, please see https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/ Review your server machine for: Suspicious user accounts Unknown processes Unknown network connections and open ports SSH configuration Firewall rules Change all passwords Starting Emby Server After (and only after) you have done the above: Disable external network access Go to the following folder under the Emby Server Data Folder : plugins/configurations Find the file named ReadyState.xml and delete it. Find the file named 'EmbyScripterX.xml' and delete it (if exists) Delete the plugin .dll file(s), which comes as helper.dll and/or EmbyHelper.dll . The primary location of these is the plugins folder under the Emby Server Data Folder Start Emby Server Assign new passwords to all of your Emby Server users Don't allow local login without password Ensure no user has an empty password Re-Enable public network access Consider changing IP address, port, or DNS name (whatever applicable) Note If possible, it would be great when you could send us the malware dll file so we can analyze to see whether different versions exist.

Amazon Alexa is a cloud-based voice service that allows you to retrieve information via voice as well as control device and apps in your Environment including Emby. You can ask Alexa to play music, hear the news, check weather, control your smart home, and more. The Emby Skill enables users to get information about and control playback of their media library on any Emby compatible device. Once you have successfully linked your Emby account to Alexa, you can start playing your favorite movies, TV shows on your devices with your voice. Get started The first step is to make sure your Emby Server is setup for remote use and has Emby Premiere.. Since Alexa is a cloud based service it will need access to your Emby server from the Internet. Please follow our instructions for setting up Remote Access. At this point please make sure you've already setup your Alexa device following Amazon directions and verify it works for general Alexa use. You can now setup an Emby Skill to work with Alexa. You do this by opening the Amazon Amazon Alexa app or the Amazon Alexa web app, navigate to the following: Skills > Your Skills > Emby > Link Account Click on the Emby Skill Now Click the Button top right to ENABLE the skill. Type in your Emby Connect username you created prior to this as well as your password and click the SIGN IN button. You can now control what Emby server to control.

    "keywords": "Backup & Restore This guide will go over the following: how to setup regular backups using the Backup & Restore Plugin how to migrate your settings from Emby Server from one machine to another how to restore the same configuration to a new additional server how to restore your server to the last backed up state how to restore your server to a specific date backup of the databases how to copy playback state and favorites from one user account to another There is also a section on manual backups. Use the Backup & Restore Plugin We recommend using the Backup & Restore plugin, which is designed to make this process really painless by doing the work for you. This plugin requires Emby Premiere and can be found in our plugin catalog. The Backup & Restore plugin can help you backup and restore the following: Server configuration Users User data: play-states & favorites Plugin settings Playlists Live TV Schedule This will not backup library contents. For metadata, there is an option to include metadata in the backups. Alternatively, configure your libraries to save nfo and image files alongside the media within the media folders and they would then be included in your own library content backups. Note If you have configured camera uploads and/or Live TV recordings, the default directories for these (data\\camerauploads and data\\livetv\\recordings) are not part of the backup. You would need to back these up yourself and re-instate on the target new location. Note When migrating to a new machine, media paths will need to remain the same as on the original server. Important Backups created on older versions of Emby Server are not compatible and cannot be restored into Emby Server 4.8. How to use the Backup & Restore Plugin Be sure your Emby Premiere key is properly installed and validated. Backup & Restore requires Emby Premiere . Install the plugin into your existing Emby Server. Make sure there are no pending updates to the plugin, requiring a server restart to be applied. Restart the Emby Server to apply the updates if the server dashboard indicates that. Launch Backup & Restore from within the Emby Server Advanced settings sidebar. Configure the Backup plugin by setting a folder to save the backups within. Decide if you want to backup metadata. If you do include the metadata sub-folders, make sure there is sufficient disk space for the backups. Backups will take much longer to run. If you wish to keep additional backups of the database files, you can specify that. By default, only one backup set of the databases is produced. Now click \"Save\" . The next screenshot shows the initial setting before configuration: Important You must set a path for backups by changing the default \"undefined\" path setting to an actual path and saving that for the backups to start. Please ensure that the system user account that Emby Server runs in, has full permissions to this backups path. Paths must be absolute and not relative. Note If running Emby Server on Windows as a Windows Service, the backup path needs to be to a local drive or using UNC path if it is an external shared network drive. This is because Mapped Network Drives would not be available to a Windows Service. e.g. Use \"\\\\server-name\\share-name\\backups-folder-name\" as path and not a mapped network drive. By default, the backup process will run once a day soon after midnight. This can be changed in Scheduled Tasks settings. In Scheduled Tasks, you can manually run the schedule for \"Emby Server Backup\" after backups setup, if you wish to confirm that the backups succeed, rather than wait for the scheduled task to run later on. Note Keep a record of what plugins you add to the Emby Server, as whilst the backup operation does save the configurations of all installed plugins, any added plugins will need to be manually installed after the restore of the server. The Plugins should only be added after you have confirmed that the restored Emby Server is operational. How to restore using the Backup & Restore Plugin Restoring to a new server installation Ensure all media is in place on the new server in the same media filesystem paths as before. Any that were within the emby server program data eg the default Camera Upload folder and Live TV Recordings folders need to be copied to within the program data path for the new server. Add the Emby Premiere key and install the plugin on your new Emby Server installation. You may need to restart the server to complete installing updates for the Backup & Restore plugin. Launch the Backup & Restore plugin on the new server and configure it to have the backup path set to where the backups are. It needs to be the same parent folder that contains your backups and then save this path. If the path is correct, after clicking \"Save\" you will see the available backup to restore from. Note if previous backups do not show up correctly, check to make sure you have selected the parent folder and not the specific folder holding the backups. Click on \"Restore from Backup\" and in the Restore Options drop-down, select \"embyserver-backup-full\" . If this new server is a replacement for the old server, ensure you have the \"Restore Server ID\" ticked. If this new server is an additional server, that will be run alongside the server from which the backup was produced, then you must un-tick the \"Restore Server ID\" option, and if using Emby Connect , re-link local accounts to Emby Connect after the restore. See Emby Connect for Users . Click on \"Restore from Backup\" You will be prompted to confirm. When the restore completes, Emby Server will automatically restart. Make sure you close all previous browser sessions accessing this new server, as they would be using the old pre-restore credentials. Note It is advisable that you do defer installing the additional plugins until you confirm that the restored server is functioning with no new issues after the restore. With the Emby Server operational and all media accessible, you can now install any Plugins that you had added to the server that is being restored. The configuration files for the plugins are automatically restored, so once the plugins are added and the server restarted to complete the plugins installation, the plugin configuration files should get picked up. Note Be aware that some plugins may have additional data eg a database that would need to be copied over manually or an application that may need to be installed. Please carefully check the requirements for each plugin. If you have Live TV configured, go to server settings / Live TV and perform a \"Refresh Guide Data\" How to Restore an earlier backup of the databases If you have specified that the backups keep a number of extra backup copies of the databases, you can use Restore to revert to an earlier backup of the databases. The restore will use the last full backup data but the databases will be from the backup date you select. Launch Backup & Restore from within the Emby Server Advanced settings sidebar. Click on \"Restore from Backup\" and in the Restore Options section, open the drop-down to see the list of previous databases copies. Select the backup for the day/time you wish to go back to. As this restore is not for a new additional server, keep the \"Restore Server ID\" ticked Click on \"Restore from Backup\" You will be prompted to confirm. When the restore completes, Emby Server will automatically restart. Make sure you close all previous browser sessions accessing this new server, as credentials may change. How to use Restore to copy media playback state and favorites You can use Backup and Restore to copy the playback state and favorites information to a different Emby user account. Launch Backup & Restore from within the Emby Server Advanced settings sidebar. Click on \"Extract User Data from Backup\" On the next screen, tick the original user accounts that are in the backup that you wish to copy the data from. For each of the selected original user accounts that are in the backup, select from the dropdown the local user account to copy the playbacks state and favorites to. In the example below, we are copying playbacks state and favorites from user My-Admin-User to user MyNewAdmin . Having made the selection, now click \"Restore from Backup\" and as per other restores, you will be asked to confirm. If you prefer to backup manually, read on.... How to Backup Manually The following instructions will detail how to manually backup or migrate an Emby Server installation. Important It is important that the Emby Server process is not running when files are backed up. Locate Emby's program data folder The path to the Emby Server Data Folder can be found in your Emby Server Dashboard by clicking the 3-dot menu next to the server name. Click the view server info menu choice The following shows different examples for a number of platforms Windows Synology NAS Linux Western Digital NAS The top path entry shows the parent location for Emby Server app data. From now on this guide will refer to this path as /ProgramData. Simply backup everything in and below /ProgramData using any tool you wish or copy all files to a backup location. Make sure Emby Server is shutdown and does not show as running in the processes list, activity monitor on Mac, Task Manager on windows. For NAS devices, use the NAS dashboard to stop the Emby Server process. Migrate to a new server If you are migrating to a different operating system care should be care should be used to make sure you match up directories properly during the restore as the directory names and locations could be different. Get a good backup as explained above from you existing system (old). Install the same version number of Emby Server to the computer about to become your (new) system. After running through the setup wizard, shut down Emby Server If space allows, make a copy of the installation to another location on disk. This is only needed if you need to check/fix access rights. Restore the backup from your old machine right over the current installation on the new system. Compare each folder's access rights on the new machine restore to the fresh installation copy. Adjust access rights as needed so they match Start Emby Server. Make any adjustments to file location you may need to make. Run a full library scan on all libraries. Review log files for any errors generated. After the Scan If your library was configured with identical paths as the old setup then user data will generally be preserved as well as user library permissions. You may still want to review the library access for each user to ensure their channel and folder access is restricted as desired."

Customizing the Upload Location There are a few options that allow you to control where the uploaded photos are saved to. By default, they are saved to an internal data folder, and all devices upload to the same folder. You can easily change the upload folder to a custom path, and/or you can also have a sub-folder created for each device. To access these settings, open the Emby Server dashboard and navigate to Devices -> Camera Upload. Note : When using a custom upload path, you will need to add that path to the server library. It is also possible to assign a custom upload path individually for a device. For more information on this, see device settings . Uploading from Apps Uploading is automatic and does not require any intervention on the part of the user. Please note that some apps will only upload under certain conditions, such as being on wifi, having a certain connection speed, or a certain battery charge percentage, as well as other device-specific factors."

Emby for Chromecast can handle just about any type of media thanks to Emby Server transcoding . If you would like to learn how to prepare your media for Direct Play, read below. Direct Play Media Formats Video — MP4, M4V, MKV, WEBM Subtitles - SRT and other text-based formats Audio – AAC, MP3, WAV, FLAC, OPUS FLAC is currently only supported by Chromecast Audio devices. All other Chromecast devices can play FLAC using Emby Server transcoding. Best Practices for Direct Play Ensure your media meets the above criteria. Leave the casting app's Chromecast streaming bitrate setting on the default value of Auto, if possible. The app will perform bandwidth tests with your Emby Server to determine the maximum playable bitrate. If you are customizing the bitrate setting, then you will need to compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

Cinema Intros is configured in the server dashboard by navigating to the Cinema Intros menu. By default it is disabled. Choosing when to enable Cinema Intros The configuration page allows you to choose the types of videos that will trigger cinema intros. Currently, Movies and Episodes are supported. A video is determined to be a Movie or Episode based upon the content type chosen when setting up the library. Internet Trailers A vast library of internet trailers are available for use with cinema intros. The categories available are movies coming soon to theaters, movies coming soon to Dvd, and movies coming soon to Netflix. This feature has two requirements: An active Emby Premiere subscription Installation of the Trailer plugin , either before or after enabling cinema intros. Local Trailers If your movie folders contain local trailers, enabling this option will allow these trailers to be used within cinema intros. See trailers for more information. Custom Intros In addition you can specify your own custom videos to be used with cinema intros. Simply create a folder containing the videos, and enter the path in the custom intro field: Important : Make sure to run a library scan after adding new intro files. Codec Intros Codec intros allow you to create intros based on the media information of the main feature you are watching. For example, if you're watching a movie with AC3 audio, you can create an ac3 intro called ac3.mp4, and place this in your codec intro path. The following fields are used to determine a match: Video Codec Audio Codec Audio Profile Tags Here are some examples: (extension doesn't matter) A movie has h264 video, intro file is named \"h264.mp4\" A movie has ac3 audio, intro file is named \"ac3.mkv\" A movie has eac3 audio, intro file is named eac3.mp4 A movie has DTS-HD MA audio profile, intro file is named \"dts-hd ma.avi\" You've added a tag to a movie called \"waffle\", intro file is named \"waffle.mpg\". Tip The file name (before extension) should be the same name as the codec shown when looking at a video for either audio codec or video codec. To review the media information for one of your videos, visit the detail screen in the web app. Simply create a folder containing the videos, and enter the path in the codec intro field: Important Make sure to run a library scan after adding new intro files. Tip With the use of Custom Intro directories you can make use of Tags for each movie/episode such as \"HomeMovies\". These tags can be added using the MetaData Manager. Make sure that Intros added to the custom directories above have proper tags in the files before adding them to Emby. You can use Windows or other tag editor to assist with this. This allows Emby to display your custom Intro for any movie tagged with the same name. Parental Control Smart parental control will compare the ratings of trailers against the rating of the movie being played, and filter the trailers based on ratings of an equal or lower value. For example, you might be an adult watching The Goonies with your children. The Goonies is rated PG, so this setting will exclude any trailers with a higher rating than PG. Unrated trailers will also be excluded. The unwatched setting will prevent trailers that you've already seen from being used again, as well as trailers from movies that you've already seen. Note that enabling this setting may eventually result in no unwatched trailers being available. User Control Once you've enabled cinema intros in the server dashboard, they'll be turned on for all users by default. Each user can opt-out of cinema intros individually by disabling it in their user profile settings. This is accessed by clicking the user icon in the top right hand corner of the web interface, then selecting Preferences -> Playback . As an administrator, if you would like to personally change this for a user, you can access this page from the Server Dashboard -> Users -> Click User -> Edit this user's playback settings ."

There are only two options that need to be set. The first option is to either import collection information or not. The second option is the required number of movies your system must have to be considered a Collections. How to Create a Collection Manually To create a collection manually, start with a Movie, Series, or any other item in your Emby library. Open the context menu for that item using one of the following methods: Right click on the poster Use the 3-Dot menu on the detail screen Mouse over the poster and use the 3-Dot menu When the context menu appears, select \"Add to Collection\". You'll then be presented with a popup where you can add the item to an existing collection, or create a new one. The easiest way to automatically download image art and meta-data is to use the same name as the collection found on TheMovieDb.Org. You can check the name on TheMovieDb.Org by doing a “collection” search on their site like \"Star Wars Collection\". In this case it would return 4 collections you can match against: Star Wars Collection Lego Star Wars Collection Robot Chicken: Star Wars Collection Star Wars: The Ewok Adventures Collection Just choose the proper collection name from the returned results. As mentioned you can add several movies at a time to a collection and also use collection names that aren’t on TheMovieDb.Org. Here is an example of a collection useful for grouping movies to a particular artist such as Charlie Chaplin. First we long press on the first poster we wish to add until we get this Next we click the top left box to select additional movies and then we click the 3 dot menu top right. We fill in the proper information and click OK to create a new collection. We now have a collection added for Charlie Chaplin without poster art or meta-data. Next, we can add our own information by editing the collection. First we can edit the text that shows up for the collection. We do this by clicking the 3 dot menu and choosing “Edit metadata” from the popup menu. We then scroll down and fill in our description in the “Overview” field and then we click Save. We manually add cover art doing a similar process. We click the 3 dot menu and select “Edit images\" from the popup menu. We now click the PLUS sign above to arrive at this screen From here you have a couple of choices. You can drag and drop an image into the dashed box or you can click the Browse button to navigate to a local image on your computer. Besides navigating and selecting local files there is a neat trick you can use to automatically download internet artwork. If you open a new tab in your browser you can do a Google Image search for Charlie Chaplin. Once you find an image that interests you right click the artwork and click the “Copy image address” option. Now that we are back to our Emby tab we click the Browse button which will open a dialog box (on Windows). We then RIGHT CLICK the file name field to paste the location we just copied from the Internet previously into this field. After pasting in the link click the Windows Open button and Emby will import the image. We can now see the image has been imported into the Emby dialog and we are ready to upload it by clicking the Upload button. It will now be added to the server. We could add additional images if needed but since we only require one image for our needs we will click the left arrow at the top of the dialog. We now have a completed manual collection that we have edited. As you can see in the picture and from the edit metadata menu there is additional information you can edit such as ratings, year, genres and other information. Removing Items from a Collection To remove an item from a collection, first browse to the detail screen for that collection. Each item in the collection will have a 3-dot menu. To remove an item, click the 3-dot menu, then select \"Remove from Collection\"."

    "keywords": "Manage Collections (Legacy) Important This does not apply to Emby Server version 4.6 and later. Collections are stored in the database with later versions. If you ever move you content around on disk after you have already created collections you will need to either rebuild those collections using the Web GUI or you can manually edit the individual text files that hold all collection info. This tutorial will cover how to manually edit your collection info. The files that hold collection information are stored in the “data\\collections” folder which is directly under your Emby Server folder. If on Windows it can look something like: C:\\Users\\SomeUserNameHere\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections An easy way to find this folder on ANY OS Emby runs on is to go to your Web Dashboard and scroll down the right side until you get to the PATHS section which will look something like this: If you look at either the LOGS or METADATA entries and remove the last part of the folder name you would have (in this example): C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\ Add “data\\collections” to the end of that line to arrive at: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections This folder will contain our list of collections which will look something like this: Each of these folders represents one collection. If we enter a folder such as the 300 Collection shown above we will have a few files that will look similar to this. You can see we have some fanart and a poster as well as the collection.xml file which will hold the information we plan to edit. You can edit this with any text edit such as NotePad or Notepad++. We’ll use Windows Notepad in this example. Once opened in Notepad we’ve scrolled down to the bottom of the file where the paths are located. You can see in this collection there are 3 files. Two normal videos and one 3D version. The paths are: F:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 F:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 F:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 Assuming we have moved all of our 3D movies to Drive G and moved our normal moves (first two) to drive M we would have: M:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 M:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 G:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 All we need to do is edit the PATHS show above in Notepad so it looks like this: Save your changes in Notepad and repeat for the next collection you need to change. Note Please make sure the paths you use exactly match the way you set your library up. If for example you setup your library using: \"D:\\movies\" but your current playlists have \"\\server\\movies\" this will not work. Make sure you are consistent and use either drive letters or UNC style paths for both the libraries and the collections. When you are finished editing your collections, please run a library update by clicking the \"Scan All Libraries\" button at the top of the Library menu page. Playlists can be migrated the same way as collections. See this article for assistance with playlist migration."

    "keywords": "Connecting from Client Apps The purpose of this document is to discuss how to connect to the Emby Server from additional devices, both within your home network and externally. To learn how to grant users access to your server, see Users . In most cases you won't need to do any extra configuration to connect to your server from other devices, as Emby apps are built to automatically know how to connect to it. But on some systems or if you have more than one emby server with remote access enabled, some manual configuration may be necessary. This document is primarily designed for troubleshooting, when the automatic features do not work and a custom configuration is needed. In-Network Connections Most Emby apps can automatically discover your Emby Server on your home network, so in those cases, there's nothing more you need to do. But in the event this does not work, you can still connect to your Emby Server by manually entering the server's address. To locate your server's internal address, simply open the Emby Server Dashboard on the Emby Server machine, typically through http://localhost:8096 and clicking on the Manage Emby Server gear icon in the top right corner. Your Emby Server's local address is then displayed in the In-Home (LAN) access field in the Dashboard view. This information can then be entered into Emby apps when making a manual connection through the Add Server option: It is recommended that the local IP Address for the Emby Server machine should be fixed. Use the router's DHCP Reservation feature to do that. Here is a general guide for doing this. https://portforward.com/dhcp-reservation/#how-to-make-a-dhcp-reservation-in-your-router Troubleshooting Internal Connections If the above still does not work, please ensure the machine running Emby Server is turned on, and that the Emby Server application is running. Check through Task Manager on Windows, Activity Monitor on MacOS, or ps -e command on Linux. A useful test is to try to use a web browser on another device, such as another computer, smartphone or tablet. You'll need to ensure the other device is connected to the same WIFI network. Try opening a web browser on that device and entering the local address manually: If this still does not work, then most likely the firewall on the server machine is not allowing access. Below are a list of troubleshooting steps that can be taken to resolve this. Open TCP Ports 8096 / 8920 & UDP Port 7359 on your server's firewall If running Windows, the built-in Windows Firewall is usually auto-configured by Emby Server. You may validate this by inspecting the Windows Firewall rules and checking to see Inbound Rules for the EmbyServer.exe for both tcp and udp and Inbound Rules for local TCP ports 8096 and 8920 and for server discovery on the local network, UDP port 7359. The port rule names are being changed and you may see them as: and for the program rules: To configure the windows firewall, see How to open a port in Windows Firewall which goes through an example of how allow a specific port through the firewall. Enter port 8096 instead of the port shown in this example. If you have secure connections enabled, do the same for tcp port 8920. And add a rule for UDP port 7359 - this is used for server discovery by client apps. Important Please do not attempt to skip this step by disabling Windows Firewall, as this usually does more harm than good. If you're using third party firewall software, you'll need to follow it's instructions to open the port. Note If you're using third party antivirus software such as Norton Internet Security, it will most likely have it's own firewall that will need to be configured. Run an AntiVirus Scan If you're certain you've opened the port and are still unable to connect, the next step will be to ensure the server machine is free of viruses and malware. See AntiVirus software . Check \"LAN Networks\" server Network setting If the LAN Networks setting is filled in with a value, make sure that the local network is included. If the field is empty and you are using only one network subnet, then this is not relevant to the problem. If you have more than one local network subnets, include all the subnets in the LAN Networks field. Use of VPN When using a vpn on your router, the requests coming into the server from within the local network may not appear as local. You would need to add the local network subnet used by the vpn to the LAN Networks server Network setting. Ensure you also include the local network subnet that the server is connected to as well. As an example, if your local network is on subnet 192.168.1.xxx and the vpn is using subnet 10.253.0.xx, then you would enter: 10.253.0.0/24,192.168.1.0/24 in the LAN Networks server Network settings covering IP address ranges 10.253.0.1 to 10.253.0.255 and 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255. See LAN Networks . CORS Mixed Content Block When using the hosted Emby Web app at app.emby.media , access to the Emby Server may be blocked when https secure connections is not enabled on the server and the access in the internet browser is through https://app.emby.media . It gets blocked by the browsers because mixed mode of https and http is not permitted. Entering the http url in the browser http://app.emby.media would get round this problem. You can establish if this is due to the CORS mixed mode error, by opening the browser Dev Console (through the F12 key) and checking the console for errors. You would see an error like this External Connections Emby Server also allows you to connect when away from home. We call these external connections because they're out of our home network. Before we begin, we'll assume everything covered above in the In-Network Connections section is functioning correctly with your Emby Server, and that you're able to connect using other devices in your home network. If not, then you'll want to go over that section first. Turn on Remote Access The first step is to ensure remote access is enabled. You do this from the Server's Network menu by enabling \"Allow remote connections to this Emby Server\". Note Once you have remote access working, if you wish to allow users to connect remotely, you will need to also enable the option for the user accounts - see Users . On the same page down below this section, you will see this option: If you have a router that supports UPnP and have this turned on, you can enable the \"Enable automatic port mapping\" feature. If you do not see this option, please install the Port Mapper Plugin from the plugin catalog. Note Most routers have the UPnP option turned off by default. If you turn on automatic port mapping in Emby Server (option shown above) and enable UPnP on your router, you likely are done and Emby will work remotely! Note If you just enabled UPnP on your router, please restart the Emby Server. Automatic Port Mapping When \"Enable automatic port mapping\" is enabled, Emby Server will initiate a port mapping request to the router for the http port, and if secure connections are enabled, to also do it for the https public port, to forward to the local ports. Automatic port mapping requires uPnP to be enabled in the router, as mentioned earlier. The public ports are by default set to: You may wish to change the public port numbers for added security. The following shows the local ports for the server. It is recommended that these local port numbers are left as per the default: There are tools available to show you what ports are mapped in the router through uPnP. These are useful, because not all routers give details of what dynamic port mapping through uPnP is active. One such tool is uPnp Wizard . If automatic port mapping does not work, you should disable the setting and switch to setting up port forwarding manually on the router. Note If you have more than one router, you will need to do the port mapping manually. See the next section. Setup Port Forwarding If you're unable to connect after testing the above settings with automatic port mapping, then you may need to setup port forwarding manually in your router to allow external connectivity to your Emby Server. To do this, turn off the \"Enable automatic port forwarding\" option just set and open the web interface for your router. If using the default public port numbers, you will need to setup a port forward rule for TCP Port 8096 on your router to port 8096 on the Emby Server machine. Do the same for port 8920 as well (if using SSL/secure connections). If you have chosen different public port numbers, then it would be these that need to be specified in the port forward rules. It is important that the local IP Address for the Emby Server machine does not change. Use the router's DHCP Reservation feature to do that. A good general guide can be found here . The process of doing a port forward will be slightly different for each router model. Here are good step by step general guides on how to do this: https://portforward.com/dhcp-reservation/#how-to-make-a-dhcp-reservation-in-your-router http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router This Youtube video also explains Port Forwarding pretty well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-R-eHiQco If you want to use different public port numbers, enter the required public ports in the server Network Settings fields. Here is an example router setup showing 2 tcp ports forwarded - using the default public port numbers: You will find different names for the ports on different routers when setting up the rules. e.g. The public ports may show on the router as WAN Port, or Public Port, or External Port. The local ports may show as LAN Port, or Local Port, or Internal Port or Private Port. Note that the Source IP / Remote IP should always be blank in a port forward rule. The server IP Address, to which the port forwards are routed to, may show on the router port forward setup page as host computer, Local IP Address, or Internal IP Address, or Private IP Address. Multiple Emby Servers on the network If you have more than one emby server on the local network, then you will need to make sure they use different public port numbers as they would be routing through the same public IP address. The default public / WAN ports are as follows: Set a different http and https port (where applicable) for each of the servers. If your first server used 8096 and 8920, then you only need to change the public ports for the other server(s) to use different port numbers. Multiple Routers If you have more than one router, eg an ISP provided router and also your own router, then that would lead to a Double NAT which would lead to failure to reach the server externally. In such cases, to get round the problem, it is recommended that one router, e.g. the ISP router, is configured to run in Modem/Bridge mode leaving the other router to do the routing and any port forwarding. If both need to be running as routers, the configuration would be more complex, needing to cascade the port forward for the public port from the first router to the second, with the first router acting as a pass-through, and to have the actual required port forward to be setup on the 2nd router. Also the 2nd router would need to have its local IP Address as a DHCP reservation on the first router. Locate Your External Address & Public Port You will need to find out what your external IP address is, when troubleshooting remote connectivity issues or to add a manual connection to the server from a remote emby client. When remote connections are enabled, your external address is displayed on the front page of the server dashboard, labeled as Remote (WAN) access . The public port is also shown. This is the address you should use when away from home together with the public port number. Verify Your External IP Address Open a browser and visit canyouseeme.org . The IP you see listed here must match what Emby shows on the dashboard. If it doesn't, remote access will not work and likely your ISP is using cgNAT or you are using a VPN. If the IP address matches, then you can proceed to test the connection through the public port. If your external IP addresses changes frequently, consider using a DDNS setup (Dynamic DNS). Verify Public IP and Port Again, you can use canyouseeme.org in a browser and enter each of the public ports that have been configured. You can also test your external address and public port by opening a web browser while away from home, or inside your home using a smart phone or tablet with the wifi connection turned off. Important Testing your external address inside your home might not work, and this is OK. Some internet routers disable loopback capabilities (going out and coming back in), therefore you might not be able to test this from inside your home network. It's important that you test away from home, or with your smart phone's or tablet's wifi connection turned off. If these succeed, your Emby Server should be working remotely and can proceed with connecting from Emby apps. But, if you find that even with this being successful, a device is still failing to connect remotely, check that you have allowed remote connections for the user account that is making the attempt. Refer to Users Settings and check that in the user settings, \"Allow remote connections to this Emby Server\" is ticked for that user account. If you continue to fail to connect remotely, you should re-check the setup mentioned above and you will need to do some further troubleshooting. See below for a checklist of the troubleshooting areas. Please visit our forums for assistance, if you continue to have an issue with this. Troubleshooting External Connections VPN If you have a VPN running on the host computer, TURN THIS OFF as that may interfere with your Emby Server routing. Anti-Malware and Firewalls If this is not the case, try temporarily disabling (turn off) any local malware & firewall software running on the same host, to see if they may be blocking Emby. If this was the cause, then you will need to look into the Firewall / Security software to configure it so that the Emby Server application is allowed to accept external connections into the local http and https tcp port for the server Local IP Address change If you are using a manual port forward setup and the local IP Address changes, then the existing port forwards will no longer route to the server. Look into fixing the local IP Address using static IP address or preferably a DHCP Reservation in the router, or both. Make sure any port forwards are updated to the new local IP address. See https://portforward.com/dhcp-reservation/#how-to-make-a-dhcp-reservation-in-your-router cgNAT Double NAT You could also be having a Double NAT setup through your ISP giving you a cgNAT (carrier grade Network Address Translation) public IP address. To check if you have been given a cgNAT public IP Address, see if it is within this IP range 100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255 If it is the case, you would need to ask your ISP to give you a static public IP address outside this range. ISPs normally have a monthly fee for this. External Public IP Address change If your external WAN/Public IP address changes, you may find that emby clients fail to connect to the server, especially if the server connection details were added manually on the client app Add Server screen. In such case, you will need to delete the server details on the client - on the Select Server screen and add it again with the new connection details. You can mitigate the impact of changes to the external IP address by exploring the use of a DDNS (Dynamic DNS service) configuration. Alternatively you can request a static Public IP Address from your ISP. There would normally be a charge for that. You can also look into using Emby Connect to link the local emby user account to your Emby Connect email address and use Emby Connect login within the app to connect to the server. See section on Emby Connect below. Multiple Routers Double NAT If you have 2 routers, eg an ISP provided router and your own router, there will be a double NAT and port mappings will not work. A Double NAT can be confirmed by checking the Public IP address displayed by https://whatismyipaddress.com/ or https://canyouseeme.org and comparing it to the WAN IP address displayed within the router configuration dashboard, the router to which the emby server machine is connected. If the addresses do not match, then most likely you have a Double NAT. To get round this, the options that you have are: Have one of the routers operate in Modem/Bridge mode, e.g. the ISP router. The other router would become the active router and handle the port forwards and port mapping. Consult the router manual for how to switch to Modem/Bridge mode. Have one of the routers operate as an Access Point, eg the ISP router becomes the router and your own router configured as an Access Point. Use both as routers but cascade the port forwards through the first router - acting as a Pass-Through. In this scenario, port mapping must be manual with manual port forward setup on both routers. As an example, if your server public http port is 32700 and https is enabled and is using public port 32800, you would do the following: Have the local IP address of the 2nd router as a DHCP reservation in the first router - so it remains fixed. You would need to find the Mac Hardware address of the WAN Port of the 2nd router and use that to specify a DHCP reservation for it in the first router On the first router, setup a tcp port forward for http port 32700 to forward to port 32700 to the local IP address of the second router. And do the same for the https port - forwarding tcp 32800 to port 32800 to the local IP address of the second router. On the second router, setup DHCP reservation for the Emby Server local IP address On the second router, setup port forwards for the http public tcp port 32700 to forward to port 8096 to the local IP address of the emby server machine. And similarly, if secure connections are used, setup the port forward for the https tcp public port 32800 to forward to port 8920 to the local IP address of the emby server machine. Multiple Servers - Public Port clash If you have more tha one system running emby server on the local network and remote connections enabled, then with the default settings there would be a public port clash and the remote connections would be attempting to go to the first system that was configured. In such cases, you will need to change the public ports and ensure that each emby server has a different public port. ISP Blocking You may also be blocked by your ISP. Open command prompt session and do a trace route to 8.8.8.8. On windows it would be: tracert 8.8.8.8 Ignore the first line which will be your own router. What you want to see is if any of the next 3 or 4 lines start with 10., 192. or 172. If the first octet number is a 172 we need to check the second octet number to see if it's between 16 to 31 (172.16.xx.xx to 172.31.xx.xx). If any of these returned lines matches this you are likely being blocked by your ISP. Emby Connect Regardless of the method used for port forwarding, whether it is automatic using uPnP or a manual configuration of the router, we suggest trying out the Emby Connect feature as it takes the guesswork out of external connectivity. The Emby apps would find the route to the server using Emby Connect. See Emby Connect ."

    "keywords": "Corrupt Database If your server log file shows SQLite errors like the following example your library.db file needs attention. SQLitePCL.pretty.SQLiteException What can cause this to happen Typical causes of this are sudden and abrupt terminations of the Emby server process, such as a power loss, operating system crash, force killing the server process, etc. Database errors could also arise if you switch back and forth between Emby Server public release and beta releases. Important Downgrade from beta to an earlier public release is not supported. Databases may be incompatible. The following logged database error indicates a corrupt database file: SQLitePCL.pretty.SQLiteException: Corrupt: database disk image is malformed SQLite tools can be used to try and recover from this. Alternatively, see if you can restore the database from a backup - refer to Backup & Restore . You should always check first, if restore from a backup resolves the issue before attempting database repairs using the SQLite tools. SQlite3 Tools may need to be downloaded on some platforms. e.g. Windows. On Mac OS, sqlite3 should be pre-installed and available to run in terminal on both intel x64 and arm sytsems. For linux, it would be best to download the latest precompiled Sqlite-Tools binary from the following link https://www.sqlite.org/download.html . Attempt to recover the database Identify the corrupt database Emby Server has 4 databases: activitylog.db , authentication.db , library.db and users.db . The main database is the library.db which tends to be the one that may end up with a corruption. There would be clues in the embyserver log file as to which database is corrupt. The following maps the internal database names to the actual database filenames: SqliteItemRepository library.db SqliteUserRepository users.db AuthenticationRepository authentication.db ActivityRepository activitylog.db As an example, the following log line within the logged error block indicates that the corrupt database is the library.db : at Emby.Server.Implementations.Data.SqliteItemRepository.Initialize Find Location of Database Files This is easily found using the ... top menu right above the server information box. Click on View Server Info We need the location of the library database files. The databases are held in the data directory under the Programme Data path shown. e.g. for linux, it would be /var/lib/emby/data . This is the path we will use in the examples below. To familiarize yourself with the different locations for the various platforms and possible need to use of ssh, see Emby Server App Data area . The examples below, will all be for the library.db database on linux. Use similar commands for other platforms. Solutions to Try in This Order If you are running on linux, ensure you have full permissions for all the commands below. You can run with root priviledges by executing: sudo -i Remove Database Locks Shutdown Emby Navigate to the folder containing your database file eg for the linux example, cd /var/lib/emby/data Delete library.db-shm & library.db-wal Restart Emby Check your server log for SQLite errors and only continue to the next step if needed. Check Database Integrity and Recover Database This step will require the use of a SQLite3 utility which is part of the Sqlite3 tools download from sqlite.org or pre-installed, e.g. on Mac OS. If you prefer a graphical based editor you can download DB Browser for SQLite which is available for most platforms. Run Integrity Check Make sure the current directory is where the database is, eg for linux cd /var/lib/emby/data Open the library.db database, e.g. sqlite3 library.db and run the following SQL command: PRAGMA integrity_check; This should return an \"ok\" when there are no corruptions. If errors are reported, we need to repair the database. type in .quit to exit Examples of results: SQLite version 3.50.1 2025-06-06 14:52:32 Enter \".help\" for usage hints. sqlite> PRAGMA integrity_check; Parse error: database disk image is malformed (11) sqlite> .quit SQLite version 3.50.1 2025-06-06 14:52:32 Enter \".help\" for usage hints. sqlite> PRAGMA integrity_check; ok sqlite>.quit Repairing the database With Emby Server shutdown, save a copy of the existing database file and then work on the actual database file. cp library.db library-saved.db Attempt to vacuum and reindex the database to see if that resolves the issue. Switch to the directory holding the database and open it: cd /var/lib/emby/data sqlite3 library.db Then run these two SQLite3 commands. The commands may take a while to complete. You may get errors indicating corruption. VACUUM; REINDEX; At the end, close the database and exit, with the .quit command. If there were no errors, then you can try to see if the issue is resolved. Restart Emby Server and check the emby logs for database errors. If database errors persist or the VACUUM or REINDEX failed, then we can try to run the .recover SQLite3 command. Shutdown Emby Server Navigate to the databases folder as before and open the database file with sqlite3, e.g. cd /var/lib/emby/data sqlite3 library.db Run these SQLite3 commands .output recovered-librarydb.sql .recover This may take a while to run. At the end, type .quit to close the database file. The recovered-librarydb.sql file will contain the sqlite3 commands to recover the database. The file may be large but it is a text file, and you should be able to view its contents - using text editors that can handle potentially very large files. We can now create a new database file using this recovery file. Create a new database file within the databases directory. Lets call it library-recovered.db . The following creates this db file: sqlite3 library-recovered.db We now need to add the content, so type in this command: .read recovered-librarydb.sql (this may take a while to run so please wait for it to finish) Enter .quit command to close the database and exit. We will now check the integrity of our recovered database (as above) using sqlite3 library-recovered.db and entering sqlite3 command: PRAGMA integrity_check; This should return an integrity_check back of \"ok\" with no errors reported. If errors are reported please report this in the forum before proceeding to Reset the Library Database. If \"ok\" and no errors are reported, continue with the next step. Make a copy of both library.db and library-recovered.db Rename library.db to library.old Rename library-recovered.db to library.db Ensure the new library.db has the same permissions and ownership as the original library- which we saved to library.old. Adjust the permissions and ownership if not. Restart Emby Server Check you server log for SQLite errors and only continue to the next step if needed Steps to Reset Library Database & Start with a Fresh new setup Shutdown Emby Change to the database location found above containing your database files Rename library.db to library.corrupt Restart Emby Recreate your media libraries"

It can be sent from the Emby server or (some clients) allowed to be played directly from the file system. The media fits all the criteria needed by the client including: Stored in a compatible file container playable by the client Encoded with compatible codecs for the client Encoded with a compatible bit rate for the client Has a resolution compatible with the client Direct Stream Also known as transmuxing. The Media file is altered in real-time while being delivered to the client. This happens when the video codec is correct but something else needs converting like the streaming type (package), audio or subtitle track. In this case the server extracts the video track from the file as well as other tracks it can use. Emby may convert the audio or subtitle tracks on the fly during a Direct Stream. Direct Streaming does not touch the video tracks in anyway so there is no loss of video quality. Direct Streaming is not very CPU intensive. Transcoding Transcoding takes place when the video needs to be converted. This could be because the video codec isn't support, the bitrate of the video is higher than the client can use, a subtitle needs to be \"burnt\" into the video. Transcoding at a high level, is taking already encoded content; decoding it; and then altering it. After altering, it is then reassembled/encoded back into a format compatible with the client app using the proper bitrate and a format the client app can use. Transcoding is more CPU intensive then Direct Streaming due to having to decode/alter/recode the video. There will be some loss of video quality when transcoding takes place. Emby supports offloading the transcoding process to a GPU"

If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

    "keywords": "Excluding Files & Folders Media files can be excluded during a library scan. This article shows how this can be done and gives details of the feature update that came in Emby Server version 4.9. Emby Server 4.9 and later Media files can be excluded by adding a file named embyignore containing the filename(s) path and/or pattern(s) to exclude. This can be added in the root folder of a library or within sub-folders. On Windows. the .embyignore file can be created using Notepad with the \"Save as type\" set to \"All files (*.*)\" When adding the .embyignore to a root folder of a library, the rules would apply to all folders. Contents of the .embyignore file Comment lines can be added by having a # character at the beginning of the line. Blank lines are ignored. Multiple patterns / names / paths can be entered on separate lines. A wildcard * can be used for file name / folder name pattern. Use forward slash character / for directory separator - even on Windows. When a directory separator is used, the pattern is relative to the directory holding the .embyignore file. Otherwise, the pattern may also match any level below the folder holding the .embyignore file. A leading / in a pattern restricts the action to the directory containing the .embyignore . Examples To ignore all .png files in a photos library, place an .embyignore file containing *.png in the root folder(s) of a photos library. To ignore all files in a folder, place an .embyignore file containing a * in the folder that is to be ignored. To ignore a folder private-vids and all files and folders below it, place an .embyignore file containing private_vids/* in the root folder of the library. To ignore a specific file e.g. private-video.mp4 , place an .embyignore containing private-video.mp4 in the folder and lower sub-folders. To ignore files with names starting with private in this folder only, place an .embyignore containing /private* in the folder. Support for .plexignore For your convenience, Emby Server now also supports .plexignore . An option has been added to Library settings for enabling this. Note There may be some differences in outcomes between our support of this feature and Plex. The Emby behavior would not match any that are defects in Plex. Emby Server 4.8 To exclude a folder from the library scan, place a file named .ignore inside the folder. This will cause Emby to ignore all sub-folders as well. On Windows. the .ignore file can be created using Notepad with the \"Save as type\" set to \"All types (*.*)\""

    "keywords": "Folder Based Access Control Emby 4.0 includes a new way to do Merged Libraries that is very powerful. If you were using merged libraries in a previous version of Emby you will want to redo your setup to take advantage of this new server based way to accomplish the same thing. The previous method was a user preference to combine different libraries of liked content. Now with version 4.0 this is all handled in the library access control making it much easier to manage. To get an idea of what merged libraries are and how to effectively use them let’s take an example where you have multiple types of TV Show content broken up and stored on disk by categories. Below is the category of TV Show and the physical location to the parent directory of each. Anime – G:\\TV Shows\\Anime Reality TV – G:\\TV Shows\\Reality TV Cartoons – H:\\TV Shows\\Cartoons Talk Shows - H:\\TV Shows\\Talk Shows Sporting Events – I:\\TV Shows\\Sporting Events News – I:\\TV Shows\\News Kids Shows – J:\\TV Shows\\Kids Shows Shows – J:\\TV Shows\\Shows Setup the Library What we are going to do is create ONE library called “TV Shows” that contains these 7 folders. We’ll do this the normal way by selecting LIBRARY from the administration web panel. We should then be presented with the following: Select \"Add Media Library\" to get to this: We will now select the content type from the drop down menu of “TV Shows” and we will also use the default library name of “TV Shows”. You can change this name to anything you want. Now the last thing we need to do to have a working “TV Show” library is to add each of the parent folder mount points shown above for this example. We do this by clicking on the + (plus sign) next to the word “Folders” above. Once we have added each of these parent folders this section will look like this: All that is left to do is click the OK button to create the library (click it). NOTE: You may configure other library options including advanced options but they are beyond the scope of this example. Configure Permissions Now that we have our new TV Shows library setup, it’s time to configure access permission to this library. Here is where the power of Merged Libraries comes into play. We are going to set access permission for our fictitious “JohnDoe” user and then we’ll show permissions for “JaneDoe” & “ChildDoe”. This will show how easy it is to have one master TV Show library but give different access to different parts depending on what content they are interested in or what content you as the administrator want them to have. From the administration web panel select the USERS menu on the left. You will then have a list of users already setup on the system in the right panel. We will pick “JohnDoe” who we already created. In the right panel you will see a menu of choices up top and will want to select ACCESS. You should then be at a screen that looks similar to this: Now for this example instead of granting access to all libraries (top checkbox in the right panel) we want to grant partial access to our new TV Shows library (only library configure on this system). So we un-check the “Enable access to all libraries” option and have a screen that looks similar to this: All we have to do at this point is make sure only the sections we want this user to have access to have a check mark. If we wanted “JohnDoe” to only have access to Anime, Cartoons, Shows & Sporting Events the configuration would look like this: Once you’re happy with the library selections just click SAVE at the bottom of the page in the right panel! Providing Different \"views\" for Different Users You can use this access control to provide different views of the same library just like merged libraries before. For example, imagine “JaneDoe” isn’t interested in any type of cartoons, kids shows or sports but very much likes News, Reality TV and Talk Shows as well as the normal collection of Shows. You can tailor her view of the TV Shows library by setting her access as follows: Then, you could also have \"ChildDoe\" and configure them to only see Cartoons and Kid's shows like this: So to recap: JOHNDOE has access to Anime, Cartoons, Shows, Sporting Events JANEDOE has access to News, Reality TV, Shows, Talk Shows CHILDDOE has access to Cartoons, Kid Shows But each one of them sees the same \"TV Shows\" library on their home screen. It is just tailored to their specific needs."

    "keywords": "Folder Sync Folder sync allows you to copy content to folders and external hard drives, for backup as well as archiving in multiple resolutions. This is an Emby Premiere feature. When content is archived in multiple resolutions, Emby apps will automatically choose the version that is most efficient for them. This will help relieve stress on your server's CPU. The availability of these versions would depend on the permissions granted when setting up Folder Sync. Installation To install Folder Sync, open the Emby Server Dashboard and navigate to Advanced and click on Plugins . Open the Catalog and scroll down until you find the Sync section. Click on the Folder Sync plugin and select Install . See Plugins Overview . Restart Emby Server to complete the plugin installation. Add Folders Decide what type of sync folders you will want to have. Examples would be sync folders containing media converted to specific resolution eg 4Mb for streaming to mobile devices or a folder to hold archived copies of the media at original resolution. These destination sync folders can be local disc drives or network shares. The Download to... button, available within the media and libraries context menus, becomes the mechanism to create the synced media files in these folder paths. Each sync folder path will need to have a name assigned. Choose naming that will make it clear to users what it is. The name will be visible when selecting media for playback and also on the Download to... menus for users that have been granted access to create Folder Sync jobs. Click on Folders + Add button Enter the path and the display name. Deselect the Grant access to all users to specify which user account(s) will be allowed to create Folder Sync jobs that will write to this folder. Ready to Sync Once a sync folder has been added, it will then show as as an available destination when creating download jobs. The target would only show for users that have been granted access. The following is what server admin user would see on a Download to... screen. See Download Options for more detail. Playback Once synced, Emby apps will automatically use the additional media sources when possible. For example, suppose you have a high bitrate movie that requires transcoding to Roku. By syncing to a folder and selecting a conversion profile that is compatible with Roku, the Roku app can then direct stream the synced version rather than transcoding the original. In this example, folder sync was used to create mobile 4Mbps versions of some media. They are available as alternative versions in playback and in this example this version was pre-selected automatically. Note There is a limit on the number of different versions for a media item. Up to 8 different versions will appear in any list of media item versions."

OpenMax OpenMax is an API specification covering various aspects of media acceleration. On Android it is the standard API for codec implementations while applications are typically using MediaCodec Troubleshooting I've enabled hardware acceleration but CPU usage is still very high when transcoding and PGS or DVD subtitles are enabled. In many cases these subtitle formats will need to be burned into the video on the fly with transcoding. Most GPUs do not support this and as a result there will be some significant CPU involvement. This is a very taxing process for even a powerful server, and it's generally something you want to avoid. Here are the best ways to avoid burning in subtitles: Turn off the subtitles prior to playback using the pre-playback subtitle selection menu Use external text-based subtitles instead, such as .srt files. Emby Server's subtitle download features can help automate the process of acquiring these. Use an Emby app that can direct play these subtitle formats without transcoding, such as Emby Windows, Emby Theater for Linux & Mac, Android, or iOS.

    "title": "HDHomeRun Setup | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "HDHomeRun Setup Emby has native support for current Silicon Dust HDHomeRun Network Tuners (must support DLNA which all models 2015+ should). Unlike other brands of tuners, HDHomeRun tuners run as standalone devices connected to your network. No need to have open PCI slots available in your server or free USB ports. Being a standalone device allows you to install these in close proximity to your OTA antenna or cable drop. As long as you can connect the device to your home Ethernet network you can install them anywhere in your home. Silicon Dust makes both OTA (Over the Air) models as well as Cable Tuners (using Cable Cards) to Receive DRM free digital cable subscription channels. In most cases, Emby can automatically discover your HDHomerun devices on your network with no configuration required. You can also manually setup a tuner as well. The following guide assumes you have already setup your HDHomeRun on your network and have connected it to your cable or antenna. Note: If you have an older HDHomeRun model that does not support DLNA or have a built in web server please perform these steps before continuing. Older HDHomeRun Support Open the server dashboard and click the Live TV menu option on the left. If you haven't setup any part of Live TV yet you should have a page that looks like this: Click the plus sign next to TV Source in order to add our first tuner. We will then be presented with a screen that allows us to choose the type of tuner to add. Select HD HomeRun from the drop down list of choices and then click the save button. Emby will search your network and present all HDHomeRun devices it finds on your network. Here is a example showing two Primes and one Quatro automatically found. In this example we are going to setup OTA (Over the Air) using the HDHomeRun Quatro. Click the Quatro (3rd on this list). Emby will start the setup of this tuner and will provide you with the ability to set a couple of options including: The ability to import all channels or only FAVORITE channels (already configured on the tuner itself). See configuration of HDHomeRun favorites below for more information on using favorites. The ability to use hardware transcoding on your tuner. Note: this is only supported on HDHomeRun EXTEND models. For this example using a Quatro we will enable the restriction of favorite channels and disable the hardware transcoding option. Once we’ve set our options the click save button and we will have added our first tuner. HDHomeRun Favorite Setup In order to make use of favorites with your HDHomeRun tuner you need to set this up outside of Emby. You do this by opening the built in web app on your tuner in a web browser and then selecting the Channel Lineup menu option. You can also just type the URL into your browser which will look similar to this: http://192.168.100.23/lineup.html Note this is the IP of the tuner as configure above in the example. Once in the channel lineup screen it will look similar to this with your channels listed. In this picture anything with the yellow star is marked as a favorite and used by the channel import above. You can use the other two options which are unselected (blank) or X as status for your own use. X would be disabled channels. Blank could be channels you haven’t decided yet. This is a really useful way to filter your channel list. Many cable providers deliver both HD and SD versions of the same channels. Using this method you can only favorite the HD channels. You can easily ignore (not favorite) channels in foreign languages, shopping channels, infomercial channels or any other channel you wish to not have Emby load."

    "keywords": "Network Setup Adjust network settings to configure Emby's built-in web server. These settings are accessed by opening the server dashboard and navigating to Server -> Network . For the purposes of this document we are defining local as within your home network, and external as outside your network away from home. LAN Networks If you have more than one local network subnet, you may need to use this setting to define the IP subnets that are deemed to be local. Also if using a vpn on the router, you should use this setting to add the local subnet address range used by the vpn. When there is more than one subnet, enter here all the IP subnets that are to be treated as local network subnets, including the subnet the Emby server is connected to. This setting is used when enforcing bandwidth controls and remote access controls. When the LAN Networks field is filled, any subnet not defined here will be deemed external and the remote access controls and external bandwidth restrictions would apply. If left blank, only the server's subnet and common private IP subnets are considered to be on the local network. See example below. Here is an example of two 256-addresses subnets defined as being local for the server: 192.168.1.0/24,10.253.0.0/24. Important When specifying IP subnets, make sure you use the correct netmask/cidr value. A /24 denotes 256 addresses Note The system API is used to determine if an IP Address is local. For the 192.168.x.x and 172.x.x.x subnets shown above, there is an override where they would always be classed as local. If you find that your 10.x.x.x subnet is not classed as local, enter the subnet together with the subnet for the server in the LAN Networks field. Important You should only use this setting, if you know you need it. Once you configure, you will need to keep it up to date - in event of network subnet changes. Local IP Address The local IP address will automatically be detected by Emby Server and this field should be left blank. But, if you wish to override that, enter here the local IP address that Emby Server should present to Emby apps. An example of when you may need to do that, is for a server with multiple network interfaces and you wish to set a specific network interface. Important Ensure the specified IP Address is a static or DHCP reserved IP Address. Local Ports This allows you to specify both the http and https local ports that the server should bind to and use. The https port would be used if secure connections (SSL) are enabled. Whilst the local ports can be customized, it is recommended that you leave them as per the default. Allow Remote Access Remote connections to the Emby Server can be disallowed or allowed using this setting. Note A similar setting is available for each user account. See users . When remote connections are enabled, further settings will show that you can customize. Remote Connections IP Address Filters You have the option to restrict remote connections to be allowed only from specific public IP addresses or IP Address subnets. The reverse is also possible, blocking specific remote IP addresses and subnets. When left blank, all remote addresses would be allowed. Public Ports This allows you to specify both the http and https external public WAN ports that the server should use when reporting its external url to Emby clients. The https port would be used if secure connections (SSL) are enabled. By default, these ports are the same as the local port numbers. You can choose alternative port numbers and in some cases - eg if having more than one server with remote connections enabled, you would need to use different public/WAN port numbers. For added security, you may also decide to having a non standard public port number. More details about added security in this article Secure Your Server . Automatic Port Mapping By default this setting is enabled and the Emby Server will attempt to automatically map public to local ports by configuring your router. It can be disabled at initial setup time or later in the server Network settings. Important Automatic port mapping uses uPnP which would need to be enabled on the router. Important If automatic port mapping is disabled but remote connections are to be used, you must setup port forward rules manually in the router configuration. Refer to Setup Port Forwarding section for information on this. External Domain When using a Dynamic DNS service (DDNS) or a domain name, enter it here without the port number. Emby apps will use this when connecting remotely. The field should be used when a custom SSL certificate is used for Secure Connections. Example: mydomain.com Checking Proxy headers to determine real client IP addresses The setting is on by default and gives added security where the server checks request headers such as X-Real-Ip or X-Forwarded-For to determine the real IP address of the sender. Optionally you can disable it or limit it to just check when the headers indicate the request is from an external source. Secure Connections (https / SSL) To enable secure connections, you will need to acquire a certificate and provide the filesystem path to the certificate and the certificate password. By default, use of https for requests made to the server is disabled. The path is to be to a PKCS #12 file containing a certificate and private key to enable TLS support on a custom domain. The Certificate password should be entered if it requires a password. Three secure connections modes are available to choose from, Preferred, but not required Required for all remote connections Handled by reverse proxy Important Some legacy devices may not be able to connect to the server using https. In such environments, do not use the \"Required for all remote connections\" mode. Note Please ensure that you are using the latest versions available for Emby Apps. For detailed information on setting up secure connections, refer to this section Using secure https connections in the Secure Your Server article. Streaming Controls With Emby Premiere , you can limit the number of concurrent video streams on the server. By default there is no limit. Note A similar setting is available for each user account which would override this global setting. See users . Internet streaming bitrate limit You have an option to specify the streaming bitrate limit in Mbps for streaming to remote devices. This limit is per stream. Bandwidth limits are not enforced by default. Note A similar setting is available for each user account which would override this global setting. See users . Network Request Protocol This allows you to optionally disable iPv6 for outgoing requests made by Emby Server. Selecting iPv4 instead of Auto would disable use of iPv6 for outgoing requests. Note This setting was introduced in Emby Server 4.9.x.x. See Also Connecting from Client Apps"

Solution To avoid this problem, you need to change the configuration of the RDP Session Host on the computer running Emby Server. This can to be done via a Windows Group Policy setting, by following these steps: Open the 'Local Group Policy Editor' via one of the following methods: Open Windows Setting and type 'group' in the search box Open Control Panel and type 'group' in the search box Start > Run > enter 'gpedit.msc' (without the quotes) and click 'OK' Navigate in the left tree Computer Configuration Administrative Templates Windows Components Remote Desktop Services Remote Desktop Session Host Remote Session Environment In the right pane, locate the entry highlighted below ('Use hardware graphics adapters for all Remote Desktop Services sessions') Right click the entry and select 'Edit' In the dialog, change the policy setting to 'Disabled' and click 'OK' Reboot the computer Background In recent Windows versions, the RDP service can use video and graphic hardware acceleration for 2D and 3D composition of remote session desktops, in latest versions it can even use H.264 video instead of GDI instructions for delivering the desktop to the client. When these RDP features are activated and a client connects via Remote Desktop, the RDP Session Host will block all D3D and DXGI for any other use than the local session. Under these circumstances, and when Emby Server is running in a local session and this session is not the one being logged into via RDP, it can happen that D3D9 based hardware accelerations are still working (sometimes with flaws, though), because D3D9 is always related to a user session context. Hardware acceleration based on D3D11 will never work in the described situation.

    "keywords": "Atmos on LG TV Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? by rbjtech Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? Background There are two primary types of Audio that can be played with Media files – Compressed Audio (ie AC3/AAC/DTS Core etc) and Uncompressed (or HD) Audio (ie True-HD, DTS-HD etc) Compressed Audio uses a lot less data (bitrate) and thus is used for streaming services such as Netflix while HD Uncompressed Audio is the primary audio on ‘physical’ media such as Blu-Ray or Ultra HD Blu-Ray disks because they have much more capacity to store the data. ‘Rips’ of this physical media may contain the HD Audio streams, the result is a technical scenario that was outside the scope of the original LG architecture design. Where does Atmos come in? Dolby Atmos is a technology where the sound is given additional data to allow it to use extra positional speakers that you may have as part of your AV Sound setup. Generally, these are ‘height’ speakers that give you the full 360 degrees experience. Atmos data can be applied to both Compressed Audio (in the form of Dolby Digital PLUS – EAC3) and HD Audio in the form of True-HD (THD). How can I get Emby to play Atmos using my Sound Bar or AV Receiver? As most people connected their DVD/Blu-Ray Player directly to the TV itself, a standard called ARC (Audio Return Channel) was introduced to pass the Audio back FROM the TV to the external amplifier. This was originally via Optical or Co-Ax cable but these days it’s via HDMI. This was great for DD/DD+/DTS compressed sound, but it was never designed for uncompressed sound as the hardware was not available. Note Streaming services/Internal LG Emby Client will use the ARC interface to pass DD+ Atmos (compressed) to a soundbar or Receiver without issue. For HD Audio however, a new standard was introduced called ‘eARC’ or Extended ARC. This only works over HDMI and importantly both the TV Hardware, TV Software/Firmware and Amplifier must all support eARC. This is where the LG problem lies On 2019 Models and later, the TV Hardware supports eARC but only from External Sources NOT the TV itself. As the Audio from the Emby LG Client is being generated ‘internally’ in the TV, then the hardware to use eARC is simply not available. Unfortunately, no firmware update can ever fix this, as the physical hardware ‘link’ is missing – a massive oversight from LG on even their newest 2020 TV’s. So in summary, you have two options to play HD Audio Dolby Atmos Option 1 If your LG TV is year 2019+ and has eARC, then you can pass the HD Audio to your Receiver or Soundbar by means of an External Player via the TV eARC HDMI Interface. Option 2 If your LG TV does not have eARC, then you can pass the HD Audio to your Receiver or Soundbar( ) directly by means of an External Player. Video only is then passed to the LG TV. No ARC or eARC is required. ( ) Note the soundbar/receiver must have an HDMI passthrough interface. Connecting the LG TV directly to the ARC or eARC enabled Receiver/Soundbar will only work for compressed Audio (DD,DD+), it will not work for HD Audio without Emby transcoding the streams."

    "keywords": "Library Setup Setting up the library is handled within the startup wizard and also within the server dashboard, located by clicking on the Library tab. Prepare Your Media It's important to first prepare your media. See other sections of the documentation for more information: Movie naming TV naming Music naming Subtitles Library Setup Page The configuration will display the media libraries you've configured and allow you to add, remove, rename or change the paths they're mapped to. A media library is a grouping of one or more physical folders on your file system. To get started, click the button to add a media library. Clicking the \"Add Media Library\" button will open a dialog to add a library. You'll have to specify a content type, enter a display name, and choose a path to the media. Content Type Choosing the right content type is important. See the above guide on media preparation for best practices for Movie, TV and Music sections. Use the unset content type if you'd like to add a media folder that mixes different content. Please note that support for mixed content is limited. Initially you'll only be able to add one media path when setting up the library, but additional paths can be added after setting it up. Library Paths Each media folder can have one or more physical library paths. When you supply more than one media path, the contents of each will be merged together into one virtual display. To add a library path, click the + button. A popup will be displayed allowing you to browse to the location in a visual manner. Note If you are going to use one of the HTPC apps (Emby Windows, Emby for Xbox, Emby for Kodi), in some cases you may find it advantageous to use the Optional Network Path feature to translate the server's local paths to network ones or define your media locations with network UNC paths that those machines can see. Giving the HTPC apps direct links may help reducing the load on the server when streaming. Warning If you have paths with more than 256 chars on Windows you may have a problem. Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation for help with this. Tip On some networks the visual browser may fail to display network devices. If this occurs you can still complete the dialog by typing in the path manually and clicking OK. Optional Network Paths By allowing Emby apps direct access to media folders on the server, they may be able to play them directly over the network and avoid using server resources to stream and transcode. Network Paths can help achieve this by mapping a path on the server to a network path that can be accessed by other devices. To learn more, see Optional Network Paths . Enable real-time monitoring To have Emby monitor changes to files and addition of content, real-time monitoring should be enabled. Important This option is only available on supported file systems. You should restart your Emby Server after changing this option Subtitles If required, you can select the subtitle language that Emby server will attempt to download. Advanced Settings If you enable Advanced Settings , you will have additional settings per library displayed. Advanced Settings include options such as: Prefer embedded titles over filenames Extract chapter images during the library scan Enable Open Subtitles subtitles"

    "keywords": "Linux/Unix Permissions Excellent advice from user Q-Droid on the Emby Forums This is an excerpt from a community thread by a member who wanted to allow other applications and Linux users on their server to access the media structure used by Emby. The member wanted shared read and write access to the libraries which may contain files and directories owned by different users. Allow group of users (my-user,Emby,Kodi,etc.) to read and write media content. Allow same for SMB shares. Generally speaking you can't prevent Emby from following the rules of the OS and in Linux/UNIX these rules were created for security reasons. A \"line of code\" won't change that because only the superuser is allowed to change ownership at the user level. Emby doesn't run as superuser and you really don't want to do that anyway. So instead you work with the rules and tools for the OS. There are multiple ways to do this, I'll share what I would do. Need elevated rights for this, i.e. root. Identify your media base directory. Usually it's the common starting directory for your libraries. For example, if your libraries look like this: /mnt/library/movies /mnt/library/tv shows /mnt/library/music Then \"/mnt/library\" is your base. Servers with multiple storage volumes and external drives can have multiple paths to the libraries without a common base. If this is the case then modify each library path individually and pick a directory from which subdirectories will be created, but not \"/\" and not \"/mnt\". On the Emby server with the media to be shared, create a group for media if it doesn't exist. The group name is arbitrary though it helps to be descriptive: group add media Add members to the group (my-user, emby, etc.): usermod -a -G media my-user usermod -a -G media emby ... We'll use ACLs. First to set the permissions and then to set the defaults. It can be done in one command but it's easier to follow this way. Members of the media group will be able to access and modify files and directories under /mnt/library. New files and directories will be created with permissions for the media group. Set permissions for media group on existing items (the 'X' is upper case): setfacl -R -m g:media:rwX /mnt/library Define default permissions for media group. Applies to new items: setfacl -R -m d:g:media:rwX /mnt/library If you're using SMB/CIFS you can enforce similar rules. Assuming the users are the same and the group can be added. In smb.conf and for each of the shares add to current config: [share name] create mask = 0664 directory mask = 0775 force group = media The above should give you enough information to get started with minimal tweaking needed."

    "title": "Metadata Manager | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "Metadata Manager One of the areas in which MediaBrowser shines as a media server is the metadata management. The server has a metadata manager which allows you to view all of the metadata for every item in your library in one place. The metadata manager can be accessed via the slide-out in the web client in the top left hand corner of the screen. Another way to access the metadata manager is via Options -> Edit of the item you would like to edit. This method will take you directly to the item in the editor. Using the Metadata Manager Refreshing metadata Each media item has the option to Refresh itself. Selecting refresh will pull fresh metadata from each of the databases that the server is configured to pull from. In addition, it will download any images that may be missing (logos, disc images, posters, etc.). The Refresh mode options will only affect the text metadata. Refreshing all data (the default option) will overwrite all of the fields with metadata from outside databases. Refreshing only missing data will preserve all of the existing metadata and only populate the fields that are missing metadata. Selecting Replace existing images will force the server to remove existing images and re-download all of the images for the media item. Identifying items All media can get their information from online databases such as TheMovieDB and TheTVDB. If an item is misidentified by the server, you can manually identify the item using the Identify button, or, if you already know the database IDs for your incorrectly identified item, simply insert the correct IDs into the database fields and refresh the item. Database IDs Database IDs are extremely important to the server to determine what each media item is and whether it has been watched. One catch to this approach is that media items with the same IDs (for example, a movie that has both a 3D and 2D version) will be treated by the server as the exact same item regardless of the existence of two separate files. This can mean that it can show up in the Resume tab or other places twice. Also, if you watch the 3D version but not the 2D version, the server will mark both formats as watched. Saving metadata Be sure to hit Save after changing ANY metadata; otherwise, all of your changes will be lost when you navigate away from the page. If you wish for the changes that you made to be persistent through a refresh of the item, you will need to either lock the metadata field you changed, or lock the entire item. Parental Controls and Metadata You should be aware that there are certain metadata fields that affect the use of parental controls. One good example of such a metadata field is the parental rating. The parental rating can be used to set whether a server user can access content that is above a certain rating, e.g. allowing a teen to access content rated PG-13 or below while restricting access to content rated at R or above. Another metadata item that you can use to prevent a user from accessing certain content is the Tags metadata field. To keep a user profile from accessing certain content Tag each item that you want to prevent access to with a unique tag. Go to the Users -> Parental Control in the server dashboard. Add the unique tag to the Block content with these tags field. Save the changes to the user profile and media tags. You can also do the inverse and only allow access to content with specific tags. Add the tag to the Allow only items with these tags field. To make sure the tags don't disappear in a library refresh, lock the Tags field in the item's metadata. Tip Tags can also be used for custom Cinema Intro trailers. Simply add a tag to each movie/episode such as \"HomeMovies\". Then you configure a path in Custom Intros for a Custom Codecs directory and add a movie with a tag (done externally) of \"HomeMovies\". This allows Emby to display your custom Intro for any movie tagged with the same name. Subtitles For your movies and TV shows, the metadata manager is the place to manage subtitles . You can see which subtitles you have, whether they are graphical or text, and what languages the subtitles are in. To enable access to the OpenSubtitles database, you will need to enter your account information in Metadata -> Subtitles in the dashboard. This area is also the place to manage what will be automatically downloaded when the Download missing subtitles task in Advanced -> Scheduled tasks is run. Images MediaBrowser can automatically download images to improve the presentation of media in each client. To enable automatic image downloading, you will need to have the Download artwork and metadata from the internet option checked in Metadata -> Basics in the dashboard. Images are downloaded from Fanart.tv, TheMovieDB, The Open Movie Database, and TheTVDB. The images tab in the metadata manager can be used to modify what images the server presents for your MediaBrowser clients. To change the image used, simply click on the cloud underneath each image and the server will search all of the databases for new images. Images can be edited using our image editing feature."

    "title": "Movie Naming | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "Movie Naming This file naming guide applies to movies, home videos and music videos. For tv episode naming, see TV naming . Library Setup When setting up the library, make sure to select Movies , Home videos , or Music videos as the content type. Emby supports several different formats and naming conventions such as ISO copies of discs to DVD/Blu-Ray file formatted layouts which are both different types of disc copies. These formats work but are not an ideal way to build your library. Since neither of these are streaming formats they require more work by the server to transcode and stream to client apps. These formats and naming conventions are covered below. A much better way of building a large Emby library of content is to prepare you media ahead of time using a streaming friendly format such as MP4 or MKV containers featuring H.264 (or H.265) video with at least one 2 Channel AAC default audio track along side any other audio tracks such as Dolby Digital or DTS. Media prepared in this fashion will have the greatest compatibility with all Emby clients. The idea behind preparing your media ahead of time in this fashion is to reduce the need for the Server to have to transcode (convert) media on the fly. This is not a requirement but is strongly encouraged. Naming your media Once you've prepared your media files, it's time to name your media in a way that allows Emby the best chance of determining what it is. The best way to do this is to use the format: \"MovieName (year).extension\" such as \"Top Gun (1986).mp4\" or \"Avatar (2009).mkv\". Because Emby allows many other advanced functions that can be used with your media we want to create a folder structure that aids in this use. The simplest method of doing this is to put all media related to a Movie in the same folder using a name \"MovieName (year). Emby will then use the folder name to determine the movie. It will look like this: \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009).mkv \\Movies\\Pulp Fiction (1994)\\Pulp Fiction (1994).mp4 \\Movies\\Reservoir Dogs (1992)\\Reservoir Dogs (1992).mp4 \\Movies\\The Usual Suspects (1995)\\The Usual Suspects (1995).mkv \\Movies\\Top Gun (1986)\\Top Gun (1986).mp4 Complex Folder Structure If you plan on having thousands of movies in your library you may want to add an additional folder to your hierarchy to aid in navigation. For example you could create folders for all movies starting with the first letter or number such as: \\Movies\\A\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009).mkv \\Movies\\P\\Pulp Fiction (1994)\\Pulp Fiction (1994).mp4 \\Movies\\R\\Reservoir Dogs (1992)\\Reservoir Dogs (1992).mp4 \\Movies\\T\\The Usual Suspects (1995)\\The Usual Suspects (1995).mkv \\Movies\\T\\Top Gun (1986)\\Top Gun (1986).mp4 When viewing your media outside of Emby using conventional tools such as Windows Explorer this allows you to navigate your library much quicker without having to wait for thousands of folders to load. It saves you from scrolling through thousands of folders to get to your \"W\" movies for example. Emby will work just fine with or without this additional folder! ID Tags in Folder & File Names Emby can also read a Meta-Data ID from the name. Supported Formats: Name (Year) [tmdbid=xxxx] Name (Year) [tmdbid-xxxx] Name (Year) [tmdb=xxxx] Name (Year) [tmdb-xxxx] Name (Year) {tmdbid=xxxx} Name (Year) {tmdbid-xxxx} Name (Year) {tmdb=xxxx} Name (Year) {tmdb-xxxx} Supported ID's: tvdb tmdb (Moviedb) imdb Example: Severance (2022) [tvdbid=371980] Emby supports the following tags with the host website for lookup. tmdbid ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) imdbid ( https://www.imdb.com/ ) tvdbid ( https://thetvdb.com/ ) Multi-version movies Multiple versions of the same content must be stored in a single movie folder. /Movies /300 (2006) /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 1080p.mkv /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 4K.mkv /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 720p.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - extended edition.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - directors cut.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 3D.hsbs.mp4 Each version must begin with the folder name, followed by \" - \". If using the dash method anything following the dash will be what you see in the Emby client app. Note The above example includes a 3D version, which is discussed in the 3D Video naming guide. Also, this feature is primarily designed for multiple qualities of the same item. It can be used for different \"cuts\" but there may be some limitations in doing that. Note There is a limit on the number of different versions for a media item. Up to 8 different versions will appear in a list of a movie versions. Movie extras Special features for movies can be stored as video files in an extras folder under movie folders. Nested folders are not supported. In addition to extras, several other sub-folder names are supported: extras specials shorts scenes featurettes behind the scenes deleted scenes interviews trailers /Movies /Home Alone (1990) Home Alone (1990).mkv /extras deleted-scenes.mkv /behind the scenes video1.mkv /interviews video1.mkv Note : Be sure the movie file is present before adding these additional \"extras\" to avoid mis-identification. Video images Images are supported in video folders. Below is a table of the supported image file names. Supported image extensions are jpg , jpeg , png , gif and tbn . Several image types support multiple file names. They are listed in the order that they're checked for. Image Type Supported file names Primary {name}.ext {name}-poster.ext {name}-cover.ext {name}-default.ext {name}-movie.ext folder.ext poster.ext cover.ext default.ext movie.ext Art {name}-clearart.ext clearart.ext Backdrop backdrop.ext, backdropX.ext fanart.ext, fanart-X.ext background.ext, background-X.ext art.ext, art-X.ext extrafanart (subfolder)/fanartX.ext Banner {name}-banner.ext banner.ext Disc {name}-disc.ext {name}-cdart.ext disc.ext cdart.ext Logo {name}-clearlogo.ext clearlogo.ext {name}-logo.ext logo.ext Thumb {name}-thumb.ext {name}-landscape.ext thumb.ext landscape.ext {name} represents the video file name, without extension. For videos that are not contained within their own folder, only the conventions using {name} are supported. For backdrops, X represents a number, and you can have any amount of numbered backdrops. For example: \\Movies \\300 (2006) backdrop.ext backdrop1.ext backdrop2.ext backdrop3.ext DVD and Blu-ray file formats Dvd and Blu-ray folder structures are also supported. To be recognized as a dvd structure, the folder must contain either a VIDEO_TS subfolder, or a VIDEO_TS.ifo file. To be recognized as a blu-ray structure, the folder must contain a BDMV subfolder. \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO Or: \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO ISO format Emby Server has basic support for videos stored in ISO format. This includes the ability to catalog the ISO's within Emby Server, and play them in HTPC-based apps such as Emby for Kodi, Emby Windows, or Emby for Xbox. Other apps will generally only be able to play them with the use of an external player. ISOs should be named just like any other video file, with one minor difference. Including \".dvd\" or \".bluray\" within the file name will allow Emby Server to automatically determine what type of ISO it is. If this is not included, it will be assumed to be DVD. \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\Alien (1979).dvd.iso \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\Léon (1994).bluray.iso \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\Scarface (1983).iso Split video files (file stacking) The following are default stacking extensions that can be added to file names. # can be 1 through 9 or A through D. Stacking is supported for video files (but only when each video is in its own folder as in the example below) as well as dvd and blu-ray folder structures. Split videos require all parts be in the same movie folder with no other videos present in that folder. ​part#​ ​cd#​ ​dvd#​ ​pt#​ ​disk#​ ​disc#​ You can also use: moviename#.ext Where # can be A through D. Examples: \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009)-cd1.mkv \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009)-cd2.mkv 3D videos 3D video files are supported. See 3D videos . Media stubs Media stubs are supported.

    "keywords": "Music Naming Emby is completely tag based which means all information is read from the tags embedded in your music tracks. Folder structure in Emby 4.6 and later versions is not mandatory but can be a useful way to organize you media. The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\\Album\\Song \\Music \\Artist Name \\Album Name 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 This is not a requirement and other structures will also work, but this is the most common method. Some other examples of supported structures are Album\\Song: \\Music \\Album Name 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 Or even a flat library of song files: \\Music 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable. Track numbers are retrieved using embedded ID3 tag information. Your first step in setting up a music library is to select your folder structure. Either of the perfectly organized structures will allow for existing disc-based images to be used. Note Emby Server supports any folder structure for music libraries, but if you wish to save metadata files directly into your media folders such as nfo, images, etc, then then a structured folder layout is necessary to help Emby Server understand which folders correspond to your albums and artists. Emby Server will happily read these metadata files from the directories in your media or from the global metadata area it manages. If it's important to you to have these files written and stored next to your media, make sure to use one of the perfectly organized options above in the dropdown, preferably the artist\\album option in the middle. What you choose in the dropdown needs to match the layout on disk. Having a hierarchy of both artists and albums provides the most flexible and organized solution. Music Images Images are supported in both artist and album folders, as well as images embedded within audio files. Below is a table of the supported image file names: Supported image extensions are jpg , jpeg , png and tbn . Several image types support multiple file names. They are listed in the order that they're checked for. Image Type Supported file names Primary folder.ext poster.ext cover.ext default.ext Art clearart.ext Backdrop backdrop.ext, backdropX.ext fanart.ext, fanart-X.ext background.ext, background-X.ext art.ext, art-X.ext extrafanart (subfolder)/fanartX.ext Banner banner.ext Disc disc.ext cdart.ext Logo logo.ext Thumb thumb.ext landscape.ext For backdrops, X represents a number, and you can have any amount of numbered backdrops. For example: \\Music \\Artist Name backdrop.ext backdrop1.ext backdrop2.ext backdrop3.ext Tagging Your Tracks All music tracks should be tagged with whatever information you want displayed in Emby. Emby should support all common tags written by Musicbrainz Picard. Other common software used to alter/write tags is Mp3tag and Tagscanner. Please make sure to write all tag version or to remove old tags. All tags should be written using unicode format. Tagging your albums and tracks should be straightforward with the possible exception of various artist or compilation albums. For these types of compilation albums if you want all tracks to show up as a single entity you want to make sure both the \"album\" and \"album artist\" fields are the same for all tracks. Otherwise the album will be split up for the various artists listed. Note Where there is not a single artist you can assign to a compilation album in the 'album artist' tag, you can set it to 'Various' or other unique value. For the 'artist' tag, multiple artists can be listed for tracks and should be separated with a \"; \" (semicolon space) as shown below. Note if you have an artist with two albums of the same name you will need to use mbzalbumids or slightly change one title to differentiate the albums or they will get combined. An example is artist Kim Wilde who has two albums name \"The Very Best Of Kim Wilde\", one from 1984, one from 2001. Music Videos To add music videos, setup a library with the type \"Music Videos\". The naming conventions for music videos are identical to movies . To identify the artists and albums of music videos, use the metadata manager . Simply edit a music video: Then enter the artist(s) and/or album: Once complete, the artist and album pages will display links to the music videos. Note You need to make sure your music files have been properly tagged using a 3rd party program. Emby uses these tags for identification. For Music videos you need to name these files the same as on the meta-data provider website which is https://imvdb.com/ Emby will use Album artwork that is local but will always pull down the Artist & People from the MetaData providers."

    "keywords": "New Media Date Handling When adding new media to Emby there are two ways the date can be configured for newly added media. The first method is to have Emby use the date the file is scanned into the system. The second method is to have Emby use the date created time stamp of the media file itself. As an example if the current date is March 20th and you have media that was created on January 10th then there are two different dates that could be used depending on the setting you have set in Emby. If you use the date created, then once this new media is scanned into Emby it will be available but likely may not show up as \"new\" media since it will have a date added of Jan 10th. If you use the scan date, then Emby will ignore the creation date and will use the date added of the exact day it first sees the media added to the system which would be March 20th. In this case the media would show up as new. There are two different ways that people use Emby and half of the users want this to function one way while the other half want it to function the other way. Emby Server allows you to set this to function exactly how you want it to work. This can be useful for example if you setup a new library or server pointing to existing media. In this case you would likely want the system to use the media creation date during the initial library build. You could then change this to use the date scanned into the library after that by changing the option. You can set this by selecting Library on the left hand administrator menu, then selecting the \"Advanced\" menu option on the header in the right side up top. Don't forget to click the \"Save\" button after making any changes to this setting."

If you would like to change the password for a user, navigate to the server dashboard -> Users -> Click User -> Password . Note : Guest passwords are managed by Emby Connect and can only be changed by the user themselves. By default all Emby apps will require authentication on each device ONCE per user. After that, the credentials will be remembered on that device enabling easy switching between profiles without needing to re-enter the password. Profile PIN (optional) If you have a shared device where you wish to secure access to one or more users that have been authenticated, you can set a PIN code for that user and then require that PIN be entered any time someone attempts to login or switch to that user. To enable this feature, simply fill in the Profile PIN field with a 4 digit number (must be numeric and 4 digits for easy entry on shared devices). Then, the first time this user authenticates on each device, the app will ask if you wish to enforce the PIN code for access each time. Answer \"Yes\" to this and then, each time you return to that profile, the PIN will be required to continue. Note This feature completely replaces the old local network only PIN feature that existed prior to server version 4.8.x. That local network only PIN is no longer supported as it is inherently insecure. This new feature should provide better functionality in both local and remote situations in a secure manner."

    "keywords": "Manage Playlists (Legacy) Important This does not apply to Emby Server version 4.6 and later. Collections are stored in the database with later versions. If you ever move you content around on disk after you have already created collections you will need to either rebuild those collections using the Web GUI or you can manually edit the individual text files that hold all collection info. This tutorial will cover how to manually edit your collection info. The files that hold collection information are stored in the “data\\collections” folder which is directly under your Emby Server folder. If on Windows it can look something like: C:\\Users\\SomeUserNameHere\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections An easy way to find this folder on ANY OS Emby runs on is to go to your Web Dashboard and scroll down the right side until you get to the PATHS section which will look something like this: If you look at either the LOGS or METADATA entries and remove the last part of the folder name you would have (in this example): C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\ Add “data\\collections” to the end of that line to arrive at: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections This folder will contain our list of collections which will look something like this: Each of these folders represents one collection. If we enter a folder such as the 300 Collection shown above we will have a few files that will look similar to this. You can see we have some fanart and a poster as well as the collection.xml file which will hold the information we plan to edit. You can edit this with any text edit such as NotePad or Notepad++. We’ll use Windows Notepad in this example. Once opened in Notepad we’ve scrolled down to the bottom of the file where the paths are located. You can see in this collection there are 3 files. Two normal videos and one 3D version. The paths are: F:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 F:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 F:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 Assuming we have moved all of our 3D movies to Drive G and moved our normal moves (first two) to drive M we would have: M:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 M:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 G:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 All we need to do is edit the PATHS show above in Notepad so it looks like this: Save your changes in Notepad and repeat for the next collection you need to change. Note Please make sure the paths you use exactly match the way you set your library up. If for example you setup your library using: \"D:\\movies\" but your current playlists have \"\\server\\movies\" this will not work. Make sure you are consistent and use either drive letters or UNC style paths for both the libraries and the collections. When you are finished editing your collections, please run a library update by clicking the \"Scan All Libraries\" button at the top of the Library menu page. Playlists can be migrated the same way as collections. See this article for assistance with playlist migration."

    "keywords": "Premiere Limits Is there a limit to Emby Premiere? All of the standard Emby Premiere membership options are designed for single-household use and carry with them a limit of 30 devices supported for Emby Premiere features. In our experience over a number of years, this standard license is sufficient for 95%+ of our users. If, however, you have a need to support more devices than this we do have several extended device options for you to choose from. The Emby configuration dashboard will warn you if you are close to or over your device limit so the best thing to do is just wait for that to show you are close and then choose a larger option if desired. Important points to remember: Very few users actually require more device support than the standard license. The limit applies only to Emby Premiere features so only apps that utilize those features will count towards the limit. The limit is a device limit NOT a concurrent connection limit. Each of your devices will need access to the internet and, specifically, mb3admin.com in order to validate the limit. The limit is tied to an Emby Premiere key, not a server so, if your key is in use on more than one server, then the limit will apply across all of them cumulatively. So how do I determine if the limit will be okay for me? Look at the Feature Matrix and note the features you use that are NOT in the \"Free\" column. Count the number of devices your users will use for just those features. Even if this count is near the limit, we suggest you just try the normal license for a month of typical usage by your users and see if it works for you (it does for almost everyone). Your server will show if you are close to or over the limit. How long does a device count towards my limit? The system tracks device usage for about a week. So you need to count only devices used regularly by your users when estimating the limit for you. It is important to understand this is a device access limit NOT a concurrent connection limit. How do I \"knock\" a device off the list? You can't. The system tracks this automatically. Note, the devices you see listed in the \"Devices\" section of your dashboard are not your Premiere devices. Premiere devices are tracked by key, not by server and only if they use Premiere features. Why can't I see which devices are counted in my limit? Your Emby server has a \"devices\" tab that shows all devices that have ever connected to that server. It is important to note that this is NOT Premiere devices as it relates to this limit. The total Premiere devices is likely much less than the ones shown in this tab. You cannot see exactly which devices are counting towards your limit at this time. The main reason we do not provide a way to do this at this time is security and privacy. To allow your server to see this exact information would require us to expose a public API that provides this information. Since we do not require you to have an account with us in order to use Premiere, there is no way for us to secure this API in a way that we are comfortable enough with to expose it. We are working on ways we may be able to do this in the future. Does my server (or servers) count as a device? No. Only apps that use a Premiere-only feature count. Can I \"stack\" licenses to get more devices? No. The licenses are only for the number of devices they indicate. The 50 device upgrade is for 50 devices exactly, not 50 additional devices. Can I buy more than one Premiere key? Yes, but you must use a different email address (which means different PayPal account if using that payment method) for each key. Since we don't require you to have an account, the email address is all we have to identify you and your key by so you cannot have two on the same email."

Emby allows you to organize, present and stream your personal media library from a machine on your home network to any number of devices on that network or even over the internet (with proper network configuration) when you are away from home. We support almost all common streaming devices plus web browsers and the server can run on many different platforms from Windows/Mac PCs to most popular NAS systems and even some powerful \"micro\" platforms such as Pi or Android boxes (Nvidia Shield). What Emby is NOT Emby is NOT a media streaming service. We do not provide access to movies or TV shows. We organize and present your own media library on your own home network. Emby has two distinct parts: Server - Store your media library in a central place Client - Clients or Apps that play back media from the Emby Server A fully-functioning Emby system requires both a Server and at least one client player. The Server includes the Emby web app which is used to manage the Server and your media library. It also features a media player, thus the minimal installation of just the server is enough to get started, but most people will want to install Emby apps on other devices for expanded client functionality. Has someone invited you to their server? If you have received an invitation to share an existing Emby server, then you can skip the server installation process and jump straight to app installation. The server is only required by people wanting to host their own media collection. Choose one of the many apps we have available: http://emby.media/download/ Or try the online web app, using the login credentials supplied by your Emby server administrator, at http://app.emby.media Follow these steps to set up your own Emby Server Prepare your media Emby identifies your media according to folder structure, file name, and type of library to which it is assigned. Once identified, Emby downloads a rich assortment of information about your media including ratings, cast, descriptions & poster art. It can often provide other content media such as movie trailers. The combination of this information creates a very rich client experience. The requirements for organizing and naming files are quite flexible, but will require some basic structure. The general recommendations are: Separate media into appropriate folders (e.g., Movies in a \"Movies\" folder, TV shows in a \"TV Shows\" folder, music in a \"Music\" folder, photos in a \"Photos\" folder, etc.) This is covered in detail in later sections. Movies should be named as \"Name (Year).ext\", for example \"Brave (2012).mp4\" TV shows should include season and episode numbers in the name, and be stored in separate folders per show. For example: \"\\TV\\Homeland\\Season 01\\Homeland s01e01.mp4\" Music should be stored within artist and album folders, such as \"\\Music\\Artist\\Album\\tracks\" Install the Server Once your media is named and organized, it's time to install the Server. The server is available on a number of platforms ranging from Windows to Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, NAS devices as well as media devices such as the Nvidia Shield TV. For more information, see installation . Install apps on your devices Once your installation is up and running and you've completed the startup wizard, it's time to install apps on your devices.

Setup Guide A setup guide is available in the Emby Community . Direct Play Media Formats Video — H.264/AVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV), on Roku 4 only: H.265/HEVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); VP9 (.MKV) Subtitles - SRT and other text-based formats Audio – AAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); MP3(.MP3, .MKV); WMA (.ASF, .WMA, .MKV), FLAC (.FLAC, .MKV), PCM (.WAV, .MKV, .MP4, .MOV), AC3/EAC3 (.MKV,.MP4. .MOV, .AC3), DTS (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV), ALAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV, .M4A) Image — JPG, PNG, GIF (non-animated) Multichannel AAC is not supported on all Roku models. Roku TV’s and Roku 4 set-top-boxes do support multichannel decode to PCM stereo. On Roku set-top-boxes Dolby Digital audio (AC3, EAC3) is only supported via pass through. DTS is only supported via pass through on both Roku set-top-boxes and Roku TV’s. You must connect your Roku player via HDMI or S/PDIF to a TV or receiver capable of decoding Dolby Digital or DTS in order to hear videos with audio tracks in those formats. Best Practices for Direct Play Ensure your media meets the above criteria. Configure your audio settings in the Roku device control panel. If you'd like DTS audio to passthrough, you'll need to make sure your Roku is configured correctly, or it may trigger transcoding. Compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

    "keywords": "Running as Windows Service Running Emby Server as a Windows Service Before setting up a Windows Service, you'll need to install Emby Server from the Emby website . To setup a Windows Service, we'll be using a program called NSSM that can turn any app into a Windows Service. To begin: Download NSSM . Make sure to choose the 64-bit or 32-bit version of NSSM to match the architecture of your Windows installation. Save nssm.exe to a folder of your choice. You'll need to keep NSSM in this folder in order for the service to function. Open a command prompt as admin and \"cd\" to the folder containing NSSM. Type \"nssm install\" to open the NSSM user interface. Follow this guide to create your Windows Service, but incorporate the following changes: Application path : path to EmbyServer.exe Startup directory : folder containing the above executable Arguments : -service Service name : Emby Server (or other name of your choice) Then, on the exit actions tab, make sure to configure the exit action to not automatically restart: This is important because without this, using the Shutdown button inside Emby Server will cause NSSM to automatically restart Emby Server. Warning Emby will not auto update while running as a service. To upgrade Emby Server, download the latest version from https://emby.media/windows-server.html .

    "title": "Secure Your Server | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "Secure Your Server This is a quick tutorial on how to secure your Emby server for free. If you are opening your server to the world, securing it is a good idea. It is also useful to provide required secured streams to external services such as Amazon Alexa, which requires https connections. General tips & best practice Here are some tips to consider. Server Admin Account Avoid having a name for the admin user account for Emby Server as admin or root. If the user name is already set as that, you can edit it through the server settings / users screen and editing the profile. Separate your admin and normal use of the emby server. Have a separate account for normal use and streaming and keep the account with server admin privilege as a separate account used just for server admin. You can control which accounts have the ability to manage the server through this user profile setting Consider hiding the admin user account (or any account with server admin privilege) from the list of displayed user accounts for login. When hidden, use the Manual Login option and enter the username an password. The following shows the various options available for hiding a user name Consider disabling remote connections for the server admin account. This can be done once the remote connections configuration is in place and working. If there is a need to make changes to the server configuration, use tools such as Team Viewer, Remote Desktop, AnyDesk etc. User Account Privileges Check all the accounts privileges in the user profiles (Server Settings / Users ) and give the least privileges, ensuring only your server admin account has the privilege to manage the server. The following shows the control level you have at the user account level. E.g. remote access can be controlled at the user level. Check that media deletion is controlled and restricted only to the accounts that you trust to give that privilege to. If you had previously granted media deletion for all libraries, reconsider and where absolutely needed, enable it for specific libraries and channels. Note You can deselect “All libraries” and select specific libraries and channels. Similarly for subtitle deletions. And for remote control, restrict the permission to control for other users to just the admin accounts. You can also disable user accounts Remote Connections If the server is only to be used locally, disable remote access at the server level by deselecting this server network setting. Note If using a vpn on the local network, you may need to have this allowed, alternatively add the vpn network subnet to the list of LAN Networks in the server network settings . When using a domain name for access to the emby server, consider not having the word “emby” as part of the domain name. Use https secure connections for remote connections. See Using secure https connections section below. When enabled for remote access and not using a reverse proxy, consider changing the default public port numbers from 8096 and 8920 to other port numbers. The public ports would need to be mapped to the local ports. This can be done either by using the automatic port mapping functionality of the Emby Server or by setting up port forwards manually in the router. See Automatic Port Mapping and Setup Port Forwarding . You also have the option to restrict remote connections to only be allowed from specific public/WAN IP addresses or subnets. The reverse is also possible, blocking specific remote IP addresses and/or subnets. The default is that all remote addresses would be allowed. Using secure https connections You'll need two things: A domain that supports TXT records A ssl certificate (PKCS #12) Get your domain Sign up for a free domain of your choice. You could use Freenom or Dynu . SSL certificate We will now create Let's encrypt ssl certificates and add it to your domain. Here is a free service to help with this SSL for free . Enter your domain on the site. i.e. yourdomain.com and create a free SSL certificate Select Manual Verification (DNS) > Manually verify domain. We now have 2 TXT records (step 2 on the SSL for free website). We will copy back the TXT records to the domain provider. Leave the SSL for free page open. We will come back to it. On the domain provider website, select your domain > Manage DNS. Let's create a new TX record. Repeat the steps for both TXT records on SSL for free. Your information should look like this. Name : _acme-challenge.{yourdomain.com} Type : TXT. TTL : 300 (if you can set it to 1, go for it). Target : qariKbGVafpb5MespqHdMaGi933yW-Z2A3shE0wIyZA You'll notice Type A records in the same section. You can remove the WWW entry. Ensure your external IP is correct. If you have a dynamic IP, you'll need to keep this updated when it changes. Wait about 15 minutes. Let the domain name and changes propagate. Back to the SSL for free website. Look at step 3, you'll see a link or two to click. Click them. If it is successful, go ahead and click Download SSL certificate. If it is not successful, wait a little longer and retry. Setup Emby with your domain and SSL certificate Now you should have a domain and a folder of ssl certificate (ca_bundle.crt, certificate.crt, private.key). We are almost done. Your Emby server requires a PKCS #12 certificate (certificate.crt and private.key combined). Use this online certificate converter . Select type to convert to: PKCS #12. This should expand the number of fields. Once completed, you'll get a new .pfx certificate. Certificate file : certificate.crt Private key : private.key Chain certificate : The ca_bundle.crt or you can also find it here, Let's Encrypt Intermediate certificate . Save the text into a .txt file. PFX password : Since the private key is combined with the certificate, set a password to secure the new ssl certificate. Remember this password, you'll need it in Emby. Go to your Emby server dashboard > Network. Save your changes and restart your server. External domain : yourdomain.com Custom SSL certificate path : point to your new certificate.pfx file Certificate password : The password you set up in the previous step. Secure connection mode : Set it to Preferred but not required or Required for all remote connections. Your dashboard should now reflect your remote access as https://yourdomain.com:port . If you followed all the steps, clicking the new remote url should reach your Emby server. If it doesn't work, verify your https ports and try connecting from outside of your network. If the dashboard is still showing the domain url with http, check that you have entered the correct certificate password. You may need to look at the server logs to see if there was an error in processing the certificate. Save all your certificate files and keys in safe location. You'll need the private key when you are ready to renew your SSL certificate (I have my own CSR option on SSL for free). Since this is all for free, it requires a bit more involvement. You will need to ensure you renew your SSL certificates (every 3 months with SSL for free) and your free domain (every year at least). If you used SSL for free, I suggest creating an account to make the renewal process easier. If you are interested in an even more secure setup, here is a community-written guide on HOW TO: NGINX Reverse Proxy ."

    "keywords": "Synology Permissions How to Set Permissions on DSM 7 . For Synology versions of DSM 7 and higher you need to assign read or read/write permissions to the system internal emby user for any directories used by Emby such as your media folders. We recommend setting read/write permissions to take full advantage of Emby's features. To set permission open the Control Panel on Synology DSM. Then open Shared Folders. Highlight the shared folder containing the media you wish to appear in Emby. Click Edit, then select the Permissions tab: Change the drop down user type to \"System internal user\" (in the red box above). Scroll down if needed until you see the emby user. Check the column to give emby at least Read Only access but we suggest granting Read/Write access like this: Click the Save button. Repeat this process for any other shares containing media for Emby. Emby Server should now be able to access the folders."

    "keywords": "System Requirements The hardware requirements for the server will depend on a number of factors including the format of your prepared media, the type of client devices used as well as how much bandwidth is available between the client and the server. If you prepare you media in a format that all devices can use, such as MP4 container, using H.264 video with a stereo AAC audio track then you won't need a powerful server normally because all Emby apps can use that format directly. If however you don't prepare your media ahead of time like this or if you don't have adequate bandwidth between the client and server to play the media AS IS then the Emby Server will assist you by transcoding (converting) your media on the fly in real-time. Transcoding is the process where media is converted from one resolution or format to another (e.g. playing Full HD media on some smartphones requires transcoding). The process is CPU-intensive, so an older/slower PC might not be up to the task. Windows, Mac, Linux, or FreeBSD computer Minimum Requirements — no transcoding Intel Core 2 Duo processor 1.6 GHz or better At least 1GB RAM for Windows/Mac OS X At least 512MB RAM for Linux Windows: Vista or later OS X: MacOS 10.13 or later Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux Recommended Configuration — transcoding HD Content: Intel Core 2 Duo processor 2.4 GHz or better If transcoding for multiple devices, a faster CPU may be required At least 2GB RAM Windows: Vista or later OS X: MacOS 10.13 or later Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux Note Emby also supports Hardware Based Transcoding using a GPU/Video card (if new enough). This can substantially reduce the CPU requirements needed for multiple transcodes in real-time! This allows the server to support numerous clients at the same time without your computer's CPU being overworked. Some GPUs can support 20+ streams. That's in addition to the streams your Emby server can handle without transcoding! Network Requirements Minimum requirements An ADSL/Cable/WiFi Internet connection for media metadata and software updates Uncongested WIFI with a strong signal using 802.11n wireless network OR Wired Ethernet network Recommended configuration An ADSL/Cable/WiFi Internet connection for media metadata and software updates 10 Megabit upload bandwidth (minimum) if serving content remotely Uncongested, WIFI with strong signal using 802.11AC wireless network Wired Gigabit Ethernet network"

    "keywords": "Transcoding Emby has the ability to convert your media during playback in order to make it compatible with all of your devices. This process is known as transcoding. In most cases, the server and the apps will automatically select the ideal settings to achieve smooth playback. This is based on a variety of factors including network performance, media information, device capabilities, and various configuration settings. In some cases though, you may choose to provide your own configuration in order to improve the playback experience. App Settings Every Emby app will have a setting known as \"Max streaming bitrate\". This is the most important setting to configure within the app that you're trying to use, and will have the greatest effect on image quality. As you increase the bitrate quality will improve, but will require a faster connection between the device and server. Ineligible formats for transcode Dvd and Blu-ray ISOs 3D videos Server Settings In addition, the server has some transcoding settings that can be configured. These are found by opening the server dashboard and navigating to Transcoding . The hardware video decoder setting allows the use of the following options: Intel Quick Sync NVidia NVENC Open MAX (OMX) VAAPI NB. This is not an exhaustive list, so please choose the correct setting in the drop-down menu. This should only be enabled if you have the appropriate hardware and may result in errors otherwise. If you're unsure, leave the setting at Auto and the system will attempt to automatically detect this. The thread count setting allows you to specify how many processors to allocate to each transcoding job. In almost all cases, this should be left to Auto as the system will adapt based on current conditions. Temporary Path The server will need to create temporary files throughout the transcoding process. The location of these files can be configured. If you specify a custom path, please ensure the following conditions are met: The folder is writable The folder is not used for any other purpose, as the server will delete all contents to keep it clean. Audio Boost When surround audio is converted to 2-channel stereo audio, this often results in a lower volume level. To offset this, you can configure an audio boost scale factor to increase the volume. The default value is 2 , meaning the volume will be doubled when converting surround audio to stereo. Why Is My Media Transcoding? Whenever possible, Emby apps will play your files directly and avoid transcoding. Transcoding will only be used when files are not natively supported by the device you're trying to play from, or the bitrate of the content is higher than the app's bitrate setting. Why Is My File Transcoding? First, compare the media format of your file to the format supported by the Emby app. You can find the media info in the Emby Web Client, at the bottom of the detail page: If the file is not natively supported, transcoding will be required. Next, compare the bitrate of your file to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of your file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of the file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it. Emby apps are beginning to support automatic bitrate detection in order to automatically select the highest bitrate possible. Most users will see best results by leaving the bitrate setting on Auto. Lastly, are subtitles selected? If subtitles are selected, then this may trigger transcoding if the app does not natively support the subtitle format. Most Emby apps have native support for text-based subtitles (e.g. srt, vtt, etc). Graphical subtitles such as PGS and VobSub are more likely to trigger transcoding. To learn more about the formats that are natively supported by each Emby app, please visit the documentation section for that app: Amazon Fire TV Android Mobile Android TV Chromecast iOS Roku Web Client My Files Shouldn't Be Transcoding. How Do I Report This? Start by focusing on a single example. Please report this in our community: http://emby.media/community/ Please make sure to supply the following information: A copy of the media info from the web interface The Emby Server log from the time you played the content The Emby Server transcoding logs from the same time (if any). Logs can be accessed directly within the server's web interface by navigating to Help -> Logs ."

    "title": "TV Naming | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "TV Naming For a simple TV folder structure, the recommended folder layout is Series (year)\\Season #\\Episode. The Episode name itself should contain the show name, the season and the episode episode number which is covered below. When setting up the library make sure to select TV as the content type. Having the year in the series name is not strictly mandatory as Emby can usually match a series without it but it helps tremendously with rebooted series and those that have broadcast in different years such as Battlestar Galactica (1978) and Battlestar Galactica (2003). The year is also very helpful for some series such as Africa (2013) which could potentially match to a few different shows without the year. For example: \\TV \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 Glee S01E01.mp4 Glee S01E02.mp4 \\TV \\Seinfeld (1989) Seinfeld S01E01.mp4 Seinfeld S01E02.mp4 ID Tags in Folder & File Names Emby can also read a Meta-Data ID from the name. Supported Formats: Name (Year) [tvdbid=xxxx] Name (Year) [tvdbid-xxxx] Name (Year) [tvdb=xxxx] Name (Year) [tvdb-xxxx] Name (Year) {tvdbid=xxxx} Name (Year) {tvdbid-xxxx} Name (Year) {tvdb=xxxx} Name (Year) {tvdb-xxxx} Supported ID's: tvdb tmdb (Moviedb) imdb Example: The Vampire Diaries (2009) [tmdbid=18165] Emby supports the following tags with the host website for lookup. tmdbid ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) imdbid ( https://www.imdb.com/ ) tvdbid ( https://thetvdb.com/ ) Complex Folder Structure In more complex situations where your top-level directory is further sub-divided before the show folders, the recommended option is to create a TV media folder and add the sub-folder locations instead of the top level folder. For example: \\TV \\A-M \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 Glee S01E01.mp4 \\N-Z \\Seinfeld (1989) \\Season 1 Seinfeld S01E01.mp4 In the above example, the recommended setup is to create a TV media folder, and then add the A-M and N-Z library paths. For more information on setting up the library, see Library Setup . DVD and Blu-ray episodes Dvd and Blu-ray folder structures are also supported. The folders can have any name, but using episode numbers will improve the ability to download and display metadata. To be recognized as a dvd structure, the folder must contain either a VIDEO_TS subfolder, or a VIDEO_TS.ifo file. To be recognized as a blu-ray structure, the folder must contain a BDMV subfolder. \\TV \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 \\Glee S01E01-E04 \\VIDEO_TS \\Glee S01E05-E08 VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Glee S01E09-E10 \\BDMV TV extras Special features for TV series can be stored as video files in an extras folder under TV Series folders. It is also possible to add these extras folders at the season or episode level. In addition to extras, several other sub-folder names are supported: extras specials shorts scenes featurettes behind the scenes deleted scenes interviews trailers The following examples show extras at the TV series level. \\TV \\Fawlty Towers \\Season 1 Fawlty Towers s01e01.mp4 Fawlty Towers s01e02.mp4 \\interviews Interview with Andrew Sachs.mp4 Interview with John Cleese.mp4 Interview with Prunella Scales.mp4 \\The Blue Planet \\Season 1 The Blue Planet s01e01.mkv The Blue Planet s01e02.mkv The Blue Planet s01e03.mkv The Blue Planet s01e04.mkv \\Specials The Blue Planet s00e01 Making Waves.mkv The Blue Planet s00e02 Deep Trouble.mkv The Blue Planet s00e03 The Abyss.mkv The Blue Planet s00e04 Dive to Shark Volcano.mkv The Blue Planet s00e05 Amazon Abyss.mkv \\The Bridge (2011) \\Season 1 The Bridge S01E01.mkv The Bridge S01E02.mkv \\behind the scenes Behind The Bridge.mkv \\interviews An Audience with Sofia Helin.mkv The following examples demonstrate season and episode level extras: \\TV \\Seinfeld \\Specials Seinfeld S00E02 How It Began (Documentary).mkv \\Season 2 \\Specials Master of His Domain (Season 2 unused standup scenes).mkv Seinfeld S02E01 The Ex-Girlfriend.mkv Seinfeld S02E02 The Pony Remark.mkv Seinfeld S02E02 The Pony Remark-behindthescenes.mkv Seinfeld S02E02 The Pony Remark-deleted.mkv Seinfeld S02E03 The Busboy.mkv Seinfeld S02E04 The Baby Shower.mkv \\S02E05 Seinfeld S02E05 The Jacket.mkv \\behind the scenes Inside Look - The Jacket.mkv \\deleted scenes The Jacket - deleted scene.mkv Note It is not recommended to have folders for individual episodes unless you also have subfolders for extras related to those episodes. It is also possible to add the type of extra as filename suffix extensions, as for the following: -behindthescenes -deleted -featurette -interview -scene -short -trailer Examples: The examples below are not real extras but just given as examples of the syntax used. \\TV \\Anne with an E (2017) \\Season 1 Anne With An E S01E01 You Will Shall Decide Your Destiny.mp4 Anne With An E S01E01 You Will Shall Decide Your Destiny-short.mp4 Anne With An E S01E02 I Am No Bird, And No Net Ensnares Me.mp4 Anne With An E S01E02 I Am No Bird, And No Net Ensnares Me-scene.mp4 Anne With An E S01E03 But What Is So Headstrong As Youth.mp4 Anne With An E S01E03 But What Is So Headstrong As Youth-featurette.mp4 Anne With An E S01E04 An Inward Treasure Born.mp4 Anne With An E S01E04 An Inward Treasure Born-behindthescenes.mp4 Anne With An E S01E05 Tightly Knotted To A Similar String.mp4 Anne With An E S01E05 Tightly Knotted To A Similar String-deleted.mp4 Anne With An E S01E06 Remorse Is The Poison Of Life.mp4 Anne With An E S01E06 Remorse Is The Poison Of Life-interview.mp4 Anne With An E S01E07 Wherever You Are Is My Home.mp4 Anne With An E S01E07 Wherever You Are Is My Home-trailer.mp4 Note Emby will not look for external metadata provider (e.g. TVDB) matches for episode-level extras; to potentially match, the extras need to be at the series or season level. Mixed Content Libraries TV series are supported in mixed content libraries using the Unset content type, but season sub-folders are required in this scenario. Episode naming conventions A number of naming conventions are supported: show name - S01E01 - Episode Name.ext show name S01E01 Episode Name.ext anything_s01e02.ext anything_s1e2.ext anything_s01.e02.ext anything_s01_e02.ext anything_1x02.ext anything_102.ext anything_1x02.ext 02 Episode Name.ext s01e02.ext 1x02.ext By date Common for long-running daily shows, you can also use the date the episode aired. anything_1996.11.14.ext anything_1996-11-14.ext anything_14.11.1996.ext Multi-Version Episodes Multi-Version Episodes are best using the following format: show name - S01E01 - Display Name 1.ext show name - S01E01 - Display Name 2.ext For example: Star Trek, The Next Generation - S01E01 - Original Broadcast.mkv Star Trek, The Next Generation - S01E01 - Digital Remix.mkv anything following the \"-\" (dash) up to the file extension will be used in the drop down version selector in your Emby client. In this case the two versions show in the interface will be \"Original Broadcast\" & \"Digital Remix\". Note There is a limit on the number of different versions for a media item. Up to 8 different versions will appear in a list of an episode versions. Multi-Episode files All multi-episode files must be part of the same season.

This screen allows administrators to add, edit and remove additional users. A local user will be displayed with a cloud if it is linked to Emby Connect . Linking a user to Emby Connect will enable an easier sign in process that doesn't require the user to know your server's ip address. For more information, see Emby Connect . Adding a User To add a user, click the + button within the Users heading: You'll then be taken to the new user page page. Any user can be granted administrative access which will allow them to utilize the server dashboard. The only required field is a user name: Before saving, you can configure library and channel access, and this can easily be changed later. Deselect All to select specific libraries and channels: After saving, you will then be able to do more customization for this user account. You can link the local user account to an Emby Connect e-mail address. See Emby Connect . You can control remote connections to the server at the user level. To manage user feature access, you can do this now or later by visiting the Users page and clicking on a user account. Feature Access Features can be granted or denied, such as the ability to delete media, download media, view live tv, manage live tv, etc. The \"Allow media playback\" option determines if the user is able to play media or not. This option is handy if you'd like to setup a user who can browse the library but not play anything. You can set a limit on the number of concurrent video streaming sessions for the user. Note that this requires Emby Premiere for it to be enforced. You can also limit the bandwidth per video streaming for devices away from the local network. If you want to allow media deletions by the user, you cam select from the list of libraries and channels. You can also decide how they can remote control shared devices. Remote controlling another user allows them to send content to devices for playback while another user is signed in. Remote controlling shared devices, such as Dlna devices, allows them to send content to those as well. These can be set now or later. Other features can also be configured now or later. These cover Downloads, Subtitles, Camera Upload, Media Conversion, Sharing playlists and some limited media information sharing on social media. Lastly, you can disable or hide a user, as well as lock them from changing their user profile settings. Disabling a user will do just that. All existing sessions from that user will be abruptly terminated. Hiding a user will simply remove them from visual login screens. They will need to enter their username and password manually. Disabling user preference access will prevent a user from changing their profile settings, such as their image, password, view preferences, language preferences, and more. This is useful for administrators who prefer to dictate these terms to their users. User Profile and Preferences These can be set now or later, through the link \"Edit this user's profile, image and personal preferences@.
