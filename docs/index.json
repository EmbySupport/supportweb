    "keywords": "3D Videos There are mulitple ways to identify a video as 3D. Identify using the web interface A video can be identified as 3D using the the metadata manager . Simply edit a video: Then select the 3D format: Identify using video file name flags In order to properly detect 3D, two tags need to be present in the filename. First, a '3D' tag has to be present. Second, one of the following must also be present, hsbs, fsbs, sbs, htab, ftab, or mvc. Tags need be be surrounded be either a space ( ), hyphen -, dot . or underscore _. Tags are case-insensitive, so both 3d and 3D will work. Examples: moviename (year).3d.hsbs.mkv moviename (year) 3d sbs.mkv moviename (year).3D-HTAB.mkv moviename (year)-3D.sbs-720p.mkv moviename (year)-3D.mvc.mkv Identify using older conventions Older file naming conventions are still accepted by placing one of the following tags within the filename: [fsbs] [ftab] [hsbs] [htab] [3d] - Indicates half side by side [sbs3d] - Indicates half side by side For example: /Movies /300 (2006) 300 (2006) [hsbs].mkv /Home Alone (1990) Home Alone (1990) [fsbs].mkv Multiple Versions 3D can even be combined with the multi-version video support discussed in the Movie Naming article. Here's an example of a movie containing multiple versions in a single movie folder, some 3D and others 2D: /Movies /300 (2006) /300 (2006) - 1080p.mkv /300 (2006) - 720p.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d-hsbs.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d.hsbs.mp4 /300 (2006) - 3d.mvc.mp4"

You will need access to the file system of the server itself as a special file is written with instructions. This prevents a 3rd party from gaining access to your Emby Setup as only the admin of the system should have access to this. From a web browser open your local server address which could be http://localhost:8096 but do NOT use Emby Connect. From the above choices click on the Forget Password choice. Fill in the account name you use to login to Emby with. In the following the account used is \"admin\". Click the Submit button after entering your admin account name. You will now get a popup message that includes the location to a file on the system you will need to open. The contents of the file will be different but similar to this: All that's needed for you to do now is open the new URL, enter the 4 digit code and then follow the prompts to reset your password. It's a rather simple process but requires access to the file system to make sure only privileged users can perform the reset."

    "keywords": "Advanced Menu This purpose of this document is to discuss how to connect to Emby Server from additional devices, both within your home network and external. To learn how to grant users access to your server, see Users . In most cases you won't need to do anything to connect to your server from other devices, as Emby apps are built to automatically know how to connect to it. But on some systems some manual configuration might be necessary. This document is primarily designed as for troubleshooting when the automatic features do not work. In-Network Connections Most Emby apps can automatically discover your Emby Server on your home network, so in those cases, there's nothing more you need to do. But in the event this does not work, you can still connect to your Emby Server by manually entering the server's address. To locate your server's internal address, simply open the Emby Server Dashboard on the Emby Server machine, typically http://localhost:8096 Your Emby Server's local address is then displayed in the Local address field. This information can then be entered into Emby apps: Troubleshooting Internal Connections If the above still does not work, please ensure the machine running Emby Server is turned on, and that the Emby Server application is running. A useful test is to try to use a web browser on another device, such as another computer, smartphone or tablet. You'll need to ensure the other device is connected to the same WIFI network. Try opening a web browser on that device and entering the local address manually: If this still does not work, then most likely the firewall on the server machine is not allowing access. Below are a list of troubleshooting steps that can be taken to resolve this. Open TCP Port 8096 on your server's firewall If running Windows, most likely you'll need to configure Windows Firewall. See How to open a port in Windows Firewall . Important : Please do not attempt to skip this step by disabling Windows Firewall, as this usually does more harm than good. If you're using third party firewall software, you'll need to follow it's instructions to open the port. Note : If you're using third party antivirus software such as Norton Internet Security, it will most likely have it's own firewall that will need to be configured. Run an AntiVirus Scan If you're certain you've opened the port and are still unable to connect, the next step will be to ensure the server machine is free of viruses and malware. See AntiVirus software . External Connections Emby Server also allows you to connect when away from home. We call these external connections because they're out of our home network. Before we begin, we'll assume everything covered above in the In-Network Connections section is functioning correctly with your Emby Server, and that you're able to connect using other devices in your home network. If not, then you'll want to go over that section first. From here, we suggest using the Emby Connect feature as it takes the guesswork out of external connectivity. You only need to read below if you're not using Emby Connect, or you're having trouble connecting. Locate Your External Address Your external address is displayed on the front page of the server dashboard, labeled as Remote access . This is the address you should use when away from home. Test Your External Address The easiest way to test your external address, is to open it in a web browser while away from home, or inside your home using a smart phone or tablet with the wifi connection turned off. Important : Testing your external address inside your home might not work, and this is OK. Some internet routers disable loopback capabilities (going out and coming back in), therefore you might not be able to test this from inside your home network. It's important that you test away from home, or with your smart phone or tablet's wifi connection turned off. If the external address works in a browser, then you're good to go, and can proceed with connecting from Emby apps. Setup Port Forwarding If you're still unable to connect after testing the above, then you may need to setup port forwarding with your router to allow external connectivity to your Emby Server. To do this, you'll need to open the web interface for your router, and forward TCP Port 8096 on your router to port 8096 on the Emby Server machine. The process of doing this will be slightly different for each router model. Here is a good step by step guide on how to do this: http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router This Youtube video also explains it pretty well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-R-eHiQco Verify Public Port To test that your public port is accessible over the internet, try testing it from canyouseeme.org If this test does not succeed, then it's an indication that your router is blocking the traffic and may need additional configuration."

Amazon Alexa is a cloud-based voice service that allows you to retrieve information via voice as well as control device and apps in your Environment including Emby. You can ask Alexa to play music, hear the news, check weather, control your smart home, and more. The Emby Skill enables users to get information about and control playback of their media library on any Emby compatible device. Once you have succesfully linked your Emby account to Alexa, you can start playing your favorite movies, TV shows on your devices with your voice. Get started The first step is to make sure your Emby Server is setup for remote use and has Emby Premiere.. Since Alexa is a cloud based service it will need access to your Emby server from the Internet. Please follow our instructions for setting up Remote Access. Alexa requests are sent from outside your network. You will need to ensure your Emby server is accessible remotely. Why is Emby connect required? Emby connect is used to provide your server information to Alexa over a secure connection.

Locate Emby's program data folder Open the server dashboard and expand the System Paths section. Locate the program data folder by referring to the outline in this screenshot. From now on this guide will refer to this path as /ProgramData. Review Paths on the Old Setup Take a look at the configuration on your old server instance. Review any paths you've configured into the server such as cache folders, channel download folders, transcoding folders, as well as any paths configured within plugins. The new server will need to be able to reach these paths, and generally will require write access. If this isn't the case, then various components of the new server may have problems. If you're in doubt, revert these settings to their defaults before proceeding. Backup Files Shutdown the old server instance and backup the following files and directories: /ProgramData/config /ProgramData/plugins /ProgramData/data/collections /ProgramData/data/playlists /ProgramData/data/displaypreferences.db/ProgramData/data/userdata_v2.db (if present) /ProgramData/data/users.db Note : Unless you use a custom Metadata path you will want to backup your /ProgramData/metadata folder to preserve your People images. The only two folder in metadata you don't need are library and views. Install Emby Server on the new machine Install Emby on the new machine as you normally would. When the startup wizard launches in the browser, do not complete it and instead shut down the server. Now take all of the files you backed up from the old server and copy them into the equivalent locations on the new server. Then launch the new server, sign into the dashboard and setup your library paths. Allow the scan to complete as normal. After the Scan If your library was configured with identical paths as the old setup then user data will generally be preserved as well as user library permissions. You may still want to review the library access for each user to ensure their channel and folder access is restricted as desired."

Customizing the Upload Location There are a few options that allow you to control where the uploaded photos are saved to. By default, they are saved to an internal data folder, and all devices upload to the same folder. You can easily change the upload folder to a custom path, and/or you can also have a sub-folder created for each device. To access these settings, open the Emby Server dashboard and navigate to Devices -> Camera Upload. Note : When using a custom upload path, you will need to add that path to the server library. It is also possible to assign a custom upload path individually for a device. For more information on this, see device settings . Uploading from Apps Uploading is automatic and does not require any intervention on the part of the user. Please note that some apps will only upload under certain conditions, such as being on wifi, having a certain connection speed, or a certain battery charge percentage, as well as other device-specific factors."

Emby for Chromecast can handle just about any type of media thanks to Emby Server transcoding . If you would like to learn how to prepare your media for Direct Play, read below. Direct Play Media Formats Video — MP4, M4V, MKV, WEBM Subtitles - SRT and other text-based formats Audio – AAC, MP3, WAV, FLAC, OPUS FLAC is currently only supported by Chromecast Audio devices. All other Chromecast devices can play FLAC using Emby Server transcoding. Best Practices for Direct Play Ensure your media meets the above criteria. Leave the casting app's Chromecast streaming bitrate setting on the default value of Auto, if possible. The app will perform bandwidth tests with your Emby Server to determine the maximum playable bitrate. If you are customizing the bitrate setting, then you will need to compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

Cinema Intros is configured in the server dashboard by navigating to the Cinema Intros menu. By default it is disabled. Choosing when to enable Cinema Intros The configuration page allows you to choose the types of videos that will trigger cinema intros. Currently, Movies and Episodes are supported. A video is determined to be a Movie or Episode based upon the content type chosen when setting up the library. Internet Trailers A vast library of internet trailers are available for use with cinema intros. The categories available are movies coming soon to theaters, movies coming soon to Dvd, and movies coming soon to Netflix. This feature has two requirements: An active Emby Premiere subscription Installation of the Trailer plugin , either before or after enabling cinema intros. Local Trailers If your movie folders contain local trailers, enabling this option will allow these trailers to be used within cinema intros. See trailers for more information. Custom Intros In addition you can specify your own custom videos to be used with cinema intros. Simply create a folder containing the videos, and enter the path in the custom intro field: Important : Make sure to run a library scan after adding new intro files. Codec Intros Codec intros allow you to create intros based on the media information of the main feature you are watching. For example, if you're watching a movie with AC3 audio, you can create an ac3 intro called ac3.mp4, and place this in your codec intro path. The following fields are used to determine a match: Video Codec Audio Codec Audio Profile Tags Here are some examples: (extension doesn't matter) A movie has h264 video, intro file is named \"h264.mp4\" A movie has ac3 audio, intro file is named \"ac3.mkv\" A movie has eac3 audio, intro file is named eac3.mp4 A movie has DTS-HD MA audio profile, intro file is named \"dts-hd ma.avi\" You've added a tag to a movie called \"waffle\", intro file is named \"waffle.mpg\". Tip The file name (before extension) should be the same name as the codec shown when looking at a video for either audio codec or video codec. To review the media information for one of your videos, visit the detail screen in the web app. Simply create a folder containing the videos, and enter the path in the codec intro field: Important Make sure to run a library scan after adding new intro files. Tip With the use of Custom Intro directories you can make use of Tags for each movie/episode such as \"HomeMovies\". These tags can be added using the MetaData Manager. Make sure that Intros added to the custom directories above have proper tags in the files before adding them to Emby. You can use Windows or other tag editor to assist with this. This allows Emby to display your custom Intro for any movie tagged with the same name. Parental Control Smart parental control will compare the ratings of trailers against the rating of the movie being played, and filter the trailers based on ratings of an equal or lower value. For example, you might be an adult watching The Goonies with your children. The Goonies is rated PG, so this setting will exclude any trailers with a higher rating than PG. Unrated trailers will also be excluded. The unwatched setting will prevent trailers that you've already seen from being used again, as well as trailers from movies that you've already seen. Note that enabling this setting may eventually result in no unwatched trailers being available. User Control Once you've enabled cinema intros in the server dashboard, they'll be turned on for all users by default. Each user can opt-out of cinema intros individually by disabling it in their user profile settings. This is accessed by clicking the user icon in the top right hand corner of the web interface, then selecting Preferences -> Playback . As an administrator, if you would like to personally change this for a user, you can access this page from the Server Dashboard -> Users -> Click User -> Edit this user's playback settings ."

There are only two options that need to be set. The first option is to either import collection information or not. The second option is the required number of movies your system must have to be considered a Collections. How to Create a Collection Manually To create a collection manually, start with a Movie, Series, or any other item in your Emby library. Open the context menu for that item using one of the following methods: Right click on the poster Use the 3-Dot menu on the detail screen Mouse over the poster and use the 3-Dot menu When the context menu appears, select \"Add to Collection\". You'll then be presented with a popup where you can add the item to an existing collection, or create a new one. The easiest way to automatically download image art and meta-data is to use the same name as the collection found on TheMovieDb.Org. You can check the name on TheMovieDb.Org by doing a “collection” search on their site like \"Star Wars Collection\". In this case it would return 4 collections you can match against: Star Wars Collection Lego Star Wars Collection Robot Chicken: Star Wars Collection Star Wars: The Ewok Adventures Collection Just choose the proper collection name from the returned results. As mentioned you can add several movies at a time to a collection and also use collection names that aren’t on TheMovieDb.Org. Here is an example of a collection useful for grouping movies to a particular artist such as Charlie Chaplin. First we long press on the first poster we wish to add until we get this Next we click the top left box to select additional movies and then we click the 3 dot menu top right. We fill in the proper information and click OK to create a new collection. We now have a collection added for Charlie Chaplin without poster art or meta-data. Next, we can add our own information by editing the collection. First we can edit the text that shows up for the collection. We do this by clicking the 3 dot menu and choosing “Edit metadata” from the popup menu. We then scroll down and fill in our description in the “Overview” field and then we click Save. We manually add cover art doing a similar process. We click the 3 dot menu and select “Edit images\" from the popup menu. We now click the PLUS sign above to arrive at this screen From here you have a couple of choices. You can drag and drop an image into the dashed box or you can click the Browse button to navigate to a local image on your computer. Besides navigating and selecting local files there is a neat trick you can use to automatically download internet artwork. If you open a new tab in your browser you can do a Google Image search for Charlie Chaplin. Once you find an image that interests you right click the artwork and click the “Copy image address” option. Now that we are back to our Emby tab we click the Browse button which will open a dialog box (on Windows). We then RIGHT CLICK the file name field to paste the location we just copied from the Internet previously into this field. After pasting in the link click the Windows Open button and Emby will import the image. We can now see the image has been imported into the Emby dialog and we are ready to upload it by clicking the Upload button. It will now be added to the server. We could add additional images if needed but since we only require one image for our needs we will click the left arrow at the top of the dialog. We now have a completed manual collection that we have edited. As you can see in the picture and from the edit metadata menu there is additional information you can edit such as ratings, year, genres and other information. Removing Items from a Collection To remove an item from a collection, first browse to the detail screen for that collection. Each item in the collection will have a 3-dot menu.

If you ever move you content around on disk after you have already created collections you will need to either rebuild those collections using the Web GUI or you can manually edit the individual text files that hold all collection info. This tutorial will cover how to manually edit your collection info. The files that hold collection information are stored in the “data\\collections” folder which is directly under your Emby Server folder. If on Windows it can look something like: C:\\Users\\SomeUserNameHere\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections An easy way to find this folder on ANY OS Emby runs on is to go to your Web Dashboard and scroll down the right side until you get to the PATHS section which will look something like this: If you look at either the LOGS or METADATA entries and remove the last part of the folder name you would have (in this example): C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\ Add “data\\collections” to the end of that line to arrive at: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections This folder will contain our list of collections which will look something like this: Each of these folders represents one collection. If we enter a folder such as the 300 Collection shown above we will have a few files that will look similar to this. You can see we have some fanart and a poster as well as the collection.xml file which will hold the information we plan to edit. You can edit this with any text edit such as NotePad or Notepad++. We’ll use Windows Notepad in this example. Once opened in Notepad we’ve scrolled down to the bottom of the file where the paths are located. You can see in this collection there are 3 files. Two normal videos and one 3D version. The paths are: F:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 F:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 F:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 Assuming we have moved all of our 3D movies to Drive G and moved our normal moves (first two) to drive M we would have: M:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 M:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 G:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 All we need to do is edit the PATHS show above in Notepad so it looks like this: Save your changes in Notepad and repeat for the next collection you need to change. Note Please make sure the paths you use exactly match the way you set your library up. If for example you setup your library using: \"D:\\movies\" but your current playlists have \"\\server\\movies\" this will not work. Make sure you are consistent and use either drive letters or UNC style paths for both the libraries and the collections. When you are finished editing your collections, please run a library update by clicking the \"Scan All Libraries\" button at the top of the Library menu page. Playlists can be migrated the same way as collections. See this article for assistance with playlist migration."

TODO: This is identical to Advanced Menu and Remote Setup This purpose of this document is to discuss how to connect to Emby Server from additional devices, both within your home network and external. To learn how to grant users access to your server, see Users . In most cases you won't need to do anything to connect to your server from other devices, as Emby apps are built to automatically know how to connect to it. But on some systems some manual configuration might be necessary. This document is primarily designed as for troubleshooting when the automatic features do not work. In-Network Connections Most Emby apps can automatically discover your Emby Server on your home network, so in those cases, there's nothing more you need to do. But in the event this does not work, you can still connect to your Emby Server by manually entering the server's address. To locate your server's internal address, simply open the Emby Server Dashboard on the Emby Server machine, typically http://localhost:8096 Your Emby Server's local address is then displayed in the Local address field. This information can then be entered into Emby apps: Troubleshooting Internal Connections If the above still does not work, please ensure the machine running Emby Server is turned on, and that the Emby Server application is running. A useful test is to try to use a web browser on another device, such as another computer, smartphone or tablet. You'll need to ensure the other device is connected to the same WIFI network. Try opening a web browser on that device and entering the local address manually: If this still does not work, then most likely the firewall on the server machine is not allowing access. Below are a list of troubleshooting steps that can be taken to resolve this. Open TCP Port 8096 on your server's firewall If running Windows, most likely you'll need to configure Windows Firewall. See How to open a port in Windows Firewall . Important : Please do not attempt to skip this step by disabling Windows Firewall, as this usually does more harm than good. If you're using third party firewall software, you'll need to follow it's instructions to open the port. Note : If you're using third party antivirus software such as Norton Internet Security, it will most likely have it's own firewall that will need to be configured. Run an AntiVirus Scan If you're certain you've opened the port and are still unable to connect, the next step will be to ensure the server machine is free of viruses and malware. See AntiVirus software . External Connections Emby Server also allows you to connect when away from home. We call these external connections because they're out of our home network. Before we begin, we'll assume everything covered above in the In-Network Connections section is functioning correctly with your Emby Server, and that you're able to connect using other devices in your home network. If not, then you'll want to go over that section first. From here, we suggest using the Emby Connect feature as it takes the guesswork out of external connectivity. You only need to read below if you're not using Emby Connect, or you're having trouble connecting. Locate Your External Address Your external address is displayed on the front page of the server dashboard, labeled as Remote access . This is the address you should use when away from home. Test Your External Address The easiest way to test your external address, is to open it in a web browser while away from home, or inside your home using a smart phone or tablet with the wifi connection turned off. Important : Testing your external address inside your home might not work, and this is OK. Some internet routers disable loopback capabilities (going out and coming back in), therefore you might not be able to test this from inside your home network. It's important that you test away from home, or with your smart phone or tablet's wifi connection turned off. If the external address works in a browser, then you're good to go, and can proceed with connecting from Emby apps. Setup Port Forwarding If you're still unable to connect after testing the above, then you may need to setup port forwarding with your router to allow external connectivity to your Emby Server. To do this, you'll need to open the web interface for your router, and forward TCP Port 8096 on your router to port 8096 on the Emby Server machine. The process of doing this will be slightly different for each router model. Here is a good step by step guide on how to do this: http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router This Youtube video also explains it pretty well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-R-eHiQco Verify Public Port To test that your public port is accessible over the internet, try testing it from canyouseeme.org If this test does not succeed, then it's an indication that your router is blocking the traffic and may need additional configuration."

    "keywords": "Direct Play, Stream & Transcoding Direct Play vs Direct Streaming vs Transcoding Emby can presently deliver your media in one of three ways: Direct Play Media file is used AS IS without any modification. It can be sent from the Emby server or (some clients) allowed to be played directly from the file system. The media fits all the criteria needed by the client including: Stored in a compatible file container playable by the client Encoded with compatible codecs for the client Encoded with a compatible bit rate for the client Has a resolution compatible with the client Direct Stream Also known as transmuxing. The Media file is altered in real-time while being delivered to the client. This happens when the video codec is correct but something else needs converting like the streaming type (package), audio or subtitle track. In this case the server extracts the video track from the file as well as other tracks it can use. Emby may convert the audio or subtitle tracks on the fly during a Direct Stream. Direct Streaming does not touch the video tracks in anyway so there is no loss of video quality. Direct Streaming is not very CPU intensive. Transcoding Transcoding takes place when the video needs to be converted. This could be because the video codec isn't support, the bitrate of the video is higher than the client can use, a subtitle needs to be \"burnt\" into the video. Transcoding at a high level, is taking already encoded content; decoding it; and then altering it. After altering, it is then reassembled/encoded back into a format compatible with the client app using the proper bitrate and a format the client app can use. Transcoding is more CPU intensive then Direct Streaming due to having to decode/alter/recode the video. There will be some loss of video quality when transcoding takes place. Emby supports offloading the transcoding process to a GPU"

The Emby team has taken a lot of time and care to ensure we are delivering an application that will bring you lots of pleasure with minimal fuss. Information: After much user feedback we have reworked our Docker images from the ground up. We are now following Docker's best practices for writing a Dockerfile . Our build begins on OBS where we are using openSUSE's Kiwi imaging system for our new base image with ffmpeg and mono pre-installed. The new image weights in just shy of 320 MB, by comparison our Debian base image was about 850 MB. Additionally, we are now using a rolling release distribution. We felt that we needed to be on the cutting edge as much a possible so our new distro of choice is Tumbleweed. Why Tumbleweed, we hope that by using openSUSE's imaging system and distros we can support as many architectures as possible and have full control of every single binary found on the system. This is how we were able to minimize the foot print of the images. Full list of changes follows: Custom base image built from SCRATCH . Tubleweed static ffmpeg (smaller footprint) S6-overlay used as our process supervisor (needed for restart and no dependencies) new installation script systemd script included emby-server script included one easy command setup Installation: Before installing our pre-configured and containerized application it is recommend you install Docker. You can install docker following these directions . Once Docker is installed proceed with the following directions. We recommend you install directly from the docker hub .

It features a REST-based API with built-in documention to facilitate client development. We also have client libraries for our API to enable rapid development. This subfolder contains all necessary files to build a Docker image for embyserver . Supported Tags: latest - latest stable release beta - latest beta release dev - latest dev release armv7 - latest stable release for armv7 or armhf aarch64 - latest stable release for armv8 or aarch64 Issues: Before reporting your issue please try updating Docker to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the Docker installation guide for instructions. SELinux users should try disabling SELinux using the command setenforce 0 to see if it resolves the issue. If the above recommendations do not help then report your issue along with the following information: Output of the docker version and docker info commands The docker run command or docker-compose.yml used to start the image. Mask out the sensitive bits. Please state if you are using Boot2Docker , VirtualBox , etc. Getting started: Installation: Docker Hub : It is recommended you install directly from the Docker Hub . The installation process and scripts are very versatile and can be adjusted by passing the right combination of variables and arguments to each of the commands. The following examples should cover most scenarios, in each, a wrapper script will be installed on the host that should ease creation and management of the containerized application. When executing the script it will create a container named embyserver . Additionally, the script will ensure that this container gets setup with the appropriate environment variables and volumes each time it is executed. Installation as current user: Start the installation by issuing the following command from within a terminal: docker run -it --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target \\ emby/embyserver instl Optionally, you can also install a systemd service file by executing: docker run -it --rm -v /etc/systemd/system:/target \\ emby/embyserver instl service To enable the systemd service for embyserver execute the following: sudo systemctl enable embyserver@${USERNAME} Installation as other user: In the following instructions adjust each command replacing username with the name of the user you wish to install and run the container as. To install the application execute and, again, adjust the command replacing username accordingly. docker run -it --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target \\ -e \"APP_USER=username\" \\ emby/embyserver instl Note, if the user is a system account, the command will need further adjustment. This is because by default the script stores settings and configuration in a hidden folder within the executing user's home directory. This can be overridden by passing the appropriate environment variable ( APP_CONFIG ) to the instl script, such as in the example below: docker run -it --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target \\ -e \"APP_USER=username\" \\ -e \"APP_CONFIG=/var/lib/embyserver\" \\ emby/embyserver instl Optionally, proceed to installing the systemd service: docker run -it --rm -v /etc/systemd/system:/target \\ emby/embyserver instl service Additionally, you can enable the service on boot by executing: sudo systemctl enable embyserver@username.service GitHub : Installation from GitHub is recommended only for the purposes of troubleshooting and development. To install from GitHub execute the following: git clone https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Build cd docker-containers/stable make instl Additionally, you can install the systemd service file after executing the above by issuing the following: make service Initial Configuration: Once the embyserver wrapper script for docker has been installed you just need to execute the wrapper script from within a terminal: emby-server On the first run the wrapper script will prompt for system paths that you wish made accessible from within the container. Enter one path per line. Adding more volumes after first run: Volumes which should be mounted within the container at runtime are kept in the volume configuration file found under the APP_CONFIG folder on the host. The location will vary depending on the type of installation. If the wrapper script was installed as the executing user the volume configuration file can be found at: ${HOME}/.embyserver/.embyserver.volumes Otherwise at: ${APP_CONFIG}/.embyserver.volumes Maintenance: Upgrading: You can upgrade the version of embyserver found within the container by executing one of the following commands: emby-server update Or by executing: docker exec emby-server update You can update the container itself by executing: docker pull emby/embyserver docker stop emby-server emby-server If you wish the docker container to automatically update upon creation, set the environment variable EDGE to 1 . Please read the Technical Details section for the various ways this can be achieved. Automatic Upgrades: In order to have the container periodically check and upgrade the embyserver binary one needs to add a crontab entry. Like so: echo \"0 2 * * * docker exec emby-server update\" | sudo tee -a /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root or echo \"0 2 * * * emby-server update\" | sudo tee -a /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root Removal: docker run -it --rm \\ --volume /usr/local/bin:/target \\ emby/embyserver uninstl Shell Access: For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using Docker version 1.3.0 or higher you can access a running containers shell by starting bash using docker exec : emby-server console Logs: emby-server logs Status of service within container: emby-server status unRAID: You can find the template for this container on GitHub. Located here . unRAID Installation: Please navigate to the Docker settings page on unRAID's Web-UI and under repositories add: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Build/tree/master/unraid-templates/emby For more information on adding templates to unRAID please visit the unRAID forums . unRAID Automatic Upgrades: On unRAID, execute the following to have the container periodically update itself. Additionally, add the same line of code to your go file to make the change persistent. echo \"0 2 * * * docker exec emby-server update\" | sudo tee -a /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root Technical information: By default the containerized application has been set to run with UID and GID 1000 . If using the automatic install method from Docker, the container is set to run with the UID and GID of of the user executing the embyserver wrapper script. Additionally, the wrapper script saves embyserver's configuration and settings in a hidden sub folder in the executing user's home directory. Most default settings can be adjusted by passing the appropriate environment variable. Here is a list of any and all applicable environment variables that can be override by the end user. Environment Variables: You can adjust some of the default settings set for container/application by passing any or all of the following environment variable: ENV VAR Definition APP_USER Name of user the service will run as.[4] APP_UID UID assigned to APP_USER upon creation, or will query APP_USER's ID.[3] APP_GID GID assigned to APP_USER upon creation, or will query APP_USER's GID.[3] APP_CONFIG Location where application will store settings and database on host.[1] APP_GCONFIG Location where application will store settings and database within guest.[4] UMASK umask assigned to service, default set to 002.[4] EDGE Update the containerized service, default set to 0(Off).[4] [1]: Variable is applicable only during install. [2]: Variable is applicable during install, when invoking installed wrapper script or systemd service. [3]: Variable is applicable only when invoking docker run directly. [4]: Variable is applicable in all scenarios. Adjusting Variables: In order to pass any of the applicable variables during install or when invoking docker run directly please read Docker's documentation on environment variables for clarification if the following examples are not clear. In the following examples will use the environment variable EDGE . EDGE has been chosen since it is applicable during all scenarios. To pass the EDGE variable will invoking docker run append the following prior to the image name. Any and all other applicable variables can be done in the same manner. --env=EDGE=1 To pass the environment variable during the other scenarios do so like in one of the examples below: From the commandline when calling the wrapper script: EDGE=1 emby-server By adjusting the systemd service: [Service] Type=simple Environment=EDGE=1 ... Volumes: /config - Folder for configuration and settings. Manual Run and Installation: Of course you can always run the docker image manually. Please be aware that if you wish your data to remain persistent you need to provide a location for the /config volume. For example, docker run -d --net=host -v /*your_config_location*:/config \\ -e TZ=America/Edmonton --name=emby-server emby/embyserver All the information mention previously regarding user UID and GID still applies when executing a docker run command. Migrating your data from an existing installation: Before proceeding please ensure you have made a backup of your emby data (i.e. tar cvf embydata.tar /var/lib/emby-server ). Additionally, please verify that you are mounting your emby data as described above. In the following example we will demonstrate how to migrate your database using the default setting that emby is deployed with. By default on Linux distributions Emby Server keeps it's data in /var/lib/emby-server , while the Docker container keeps it's data in /config . That being said one could migrate their database as follows: docker exec -ti emby-server bash s6-svc -d /run/s6/services/emby-server migrate_db /config/data/library.db /var/lib/emby-server /config s6-svc -u /run/s6/services/emby-server exit"

These 3 options are blank by default and the example above shows custom settings. You can set custom start and end times to pad your recordings. These are blank by default but in this example both were set to 5 minutes. With the above settings in place all recordings schedule will have a default start time of 5 minutes before the scheduled time and will end 5 minutes after the scheduled end time. When individual events are schedule to record by a user in any Emby Application these settings will be the default used. This can be overrode for each individual recording if needed. For example people recording sporting events will often change the end time to 30 or 60 minutes to make any overtime play is taken into consideration. These next two sections are advanced functionality that won’t be covered here. This is for people who create scripts or programs that manipulate recordings after they finish.

    "keywords": "Folder Based Access Control Emby 4.0 includes a new way to do Merged Libraries that is very powerful. If you were using merged libraries in a previous version of Emby you will want to redo your setup to take advantage of this new server based way to accomplish the same thing. The previous method was a user preference to combine different libraries of liked content. Now with version 4.0 this is all handled in the library access control making it much easier to manage. To get an idea of what merged libraries are and how to effectively use them let’s take an example where you have multiple types of TV Show content broken up and stored on disk by categories. Below is the category of TV Show and the physical location to the parent directory of each. Anime – G:\\TV Shows\\Anime Reality TV – G:\\TV Shows\\Reality TV Cartoons – H:\\TV Shows\\Cartoons Talk Shows - H:\\TV Shows\\Talk Shows Sporting Events – I:\\TV Shows\\Sporting Events News – I:\\TV Shows\\News Kids Shows – J:\\TV Shows\\Kids Shows Shows – J:\\TV Shows\\Shows Setup the Library What we are going to do is create ONE library called “TV Shows” that contains these 7 folders. We’ll do this the normal way by selecting LIBRARY from the administration web panel. We should then be presented with the following: Select \"Add Media Library\" to get to this: We will now select the content type from the drop down menu of “TV Shows” and we will also use the default library name of “TV Shows”. You can change this name to anything you want. Now the last thing we need to do to have a working “TV Show” library is to add each of the parent folder mount points shown above for this example. We do this by clicking on the + (plus sign) next to the word “Folders” above. Once we have added each of these parent folders this section will look like this: All that is left to do is click the OK button to create the library (click it). NOTE: You may configure other library options including advanced options but they are beyond the scope of this example. Configure Permissions Now that we have our new TV Shows library setup, it’s time to configure access permission to this library. Here is where the power of Merged Libraries comes into play. We are going to set access permission for our fictitious “JohnDoe” user and then we’ll show permissions for “JaneDoe” & “ChildDoe”. This will show how easy it is to have one master TV Show library but give different access to different parts depending on what content they are interested in or what content you as the administrator want them to have. From the administration web panel select the USERS menu on the left. You will then have a list of users already setup on the system in the right panel. We will pick “JohnDoe” who we already created. In the right panel you will see a menu of choices up top and will want to select ACCESS. You should then be at a screen that looks similar to this: Now for this example instead of granting access to all libraries (top checkbox in the right panel) we want to grant partial access to our new TV Shows library (only library configure on this system). So we un-check the “Enable access to all libraries” option and have a screen that looks similar to this: All we have to do at this point is make sure only the sections we want this user to have access to have a check mark. If we wanted “JohnDoe” to only have access to Anime, Cartoons, Shows & Sporting Events the configuration would look like this: Once you’re happy with the library selections just click SAVE at the bottom of the page in the right panel! Providing Different \"views\" for Different Users You can use this access control to provide different views of the same library just like merged libraries before. For example, imagine “JaneDoe” isn’t interested in any type of cartoons, kids shows or sports but very much likes News, Reality TV and Talk Shows as well as the normal collection of Shows. You can tailor her view of the TV Shows library by setting her access as follows: Then, you could also have \"ChildDoe\" and configure them to only see Cartoons and Kid's shows like this: So to recap: JOHNDOE has access to Anime, Cartoons, Shows, Sporting Events JANEDOE has access to News, Reality TV, Shows, Talk Shows CHILDDOE has access to Cartoons, Kid Shows But each one of them sees the same \"TV Shows\" library on their home screen. It is just tailored to their specific needs."

When content is archived in multiple resolutions, Emby apps will automatically choose the version that is most efficient for them. This will help relieve stress on your server's CPU. Installation To install folder sync, open the Emby Server Dashboard and navigate to Sync -> Services . Click on Folder Sync underneath Available Services . Then proceed to install it on the installation page. Add Folders Once installed, it's time to start adding Folders. These folders are destinations that you'd like to sync to , such as an external hard drive or network share. Add a folder by entering the path and giving it a display name. You can also choose whether or not to limit sync access to specific users. Ready to Sync Once a sync folder has been added, it will then show as as an available destination when creating sync jobs: Playback Once synced, Emby apps will automatically use the additional media sources when possible. For example, suppose you have a high bitrate movie that requires transcoding to Roku. By syncing to a folder and selecting a conversion profile that is compatible with Roku, the Roku app can then direct stream the synced version rather than transcoding the original."

Google Home is a powerful speaker and voice Assistant. Play your music. Call your friends. Ask it questions. Control your home. It's your own Google, always ready to help. The Emby Skill enables users to get information about and control playback of their media library on any Emby compatible device. Once you have succesfully linked your Emby account to Google Home, you can start playing your favorite movies, TV shows on your devices with your voice. Get started The first step is to add Emby to your Google Home account by following the steps here and searching for the Emby home app within actions (this is not a home control app). Once this is done, you will need Emby Connect to link your Emby account to Google Home. Emby home also requires Emby premiere . Google Home requests are sent from outside your network. You will need to ensure your Emby server is accessible remotely. Why is Emby connect required? Emby connect is used to provide your server information to Google Home over a secure connection.

In many cases these subtitle formats will need to be burned into the video on the fly with transcoding. Most GPU's do not support this and as a result there will be some significant CPU involvement. This is a very taxing process for even a powerful server, and it's generally something you want to avoid. Here are the best ways to avoid burning in subtitles: Turn off the subtitles prior to playback using the pre-playback subtitle selection menu Use external text-based subtitles instead, such as .srt files. Emby Server's subtitle download features can help automate the process of acquiring these. Use an Emby app that can direct play these subtitle formats without transcoding, such as Emby Theater, Android, or iOS.

    "keywords": "HDHomeRun Setup Emby has native support for Silicon Dust HDHomeRun Network Tuners. Unlike other brands of tuners, HDHomeRun tuners run as standalone devices connected to your network. No need to have open PCI slots available in your server or free USB ports. Being a standalone device allows you to install these in close proximity to your OTA antenna or cable drop. As long as you can connect the device to your home Ethernet network you can install them anywhere in your home. Silicon Dust makes both OTA (Over the Air) models as well as Cable Tuners (using Cable Cards) to Receive DRM free digital cable subscription channels. In most cases, Emby can automatically discover your HDHomerun devices on your network with no configuration required. You can also manually setup a tuner as well. The following guide assumes you have already setup your HDHomeRun on your network and have connected it to your cable or antenna. Note: If you have an older HDHomeRun model that does not support DLNA or have a built in web server please perform these steps before continuing. Older HDHomeRun Support Open the server dashboard and click the Live TV menu option on the left. If you haven't setup any part of Live TV yet you should have a page that looks like this: Click the plus sign next to TV Source in order to add our first tuner. We will then be presented with a screen that allows us to choose the type of tuner to add. Select HD HomeRun from the drop down list of choices and then click the save button. Emby will search your network and present all HDHomeRun devices it finds on your network. Here is a example showing two Primes and one Quatro automatically found. In this example we are going to setup OTA (Over the Air) using the HDHomeRun Quatro. Click the Quatro (3rd on this list). Emby will start the setup of this tuner and will provide you with the ability to set a couple of options including: The ability to import all channels or only FAVORITE channels (already configured on the tuner itself). See configuration of HDHomeRun favorites below for more information on using favorites. The ability to use hardware transcoding on your tuner. Note: this is only supported on HDHomeRun EXTEND models. For this example using a Quatro we will enable the restriction of favorite channels and disable the hardware transcoding option. Once we’ve set our options the click save button and we will have added our first tuner. HDHomeRun Favorite Setup In order to make use of favorites with your HDHomeRun tuner you need to set this up outside of Emby. You do this by opening the built in web app on your tuner in a web brower and then selecting the Channel Lineup menu option. You can also just type the URL into your brower which will look similar to this: http://192.168.100.23/lineup.html Note this is the IP of the tuner as configure above in the example. Once in the channel lineup screen it will look similar to this with your channels listed. In this picture anything with the yellow star is marked as a favorite and used by the channel import above. You can use the other two options which are unselected (blank) or X as status for your own use. X would be disabled channels. Blank could be channels you haven’t decided yet. This is a really useful way to filter your channel list. Many cable providers deliver both HD and SD versions of the same channels. Using this method you can only favorite the HD channels. You can easily ignore (not favorite) channels in foreign languages, shopping channels, infomercial channels or any other channel you wish to not have Emby load."

If you are using a DDNS, or the Https feature with a self-signed certificate, then you may prefer to customize it. Https Ports The local and public https ports can be configured in much the same way as regular http: In addition you can also supply your own custom SSL certificate. This is highly recommended for https usage. If omitted, the server will create a self-signed certificate. Requiring Https Emby apps use http by default. In order to force them to use https, you can configure the server to report it's default external url as the http url. Note : Https is a new feature.

Solution To avoid this problem, you need to change the configuration of the RDP Session Host on the computer running Emby Server. This can to be done via a Windows Group Policy setting, by following these steps: Open the 'Local Group Policy Editor' via one of the following methods: Open Windows Setting and type 'group' in the search box Open Control Panel and type 'group' in the search box Start > Run > enter 'gpedit.msc' (without the quotes) and click 'OK' Navigate in the left tree Computer Configuration Administrative Templates Windows Components Remote Desktop Services Remote Desktop Session Host Remote Session Environment In the right pane, locate the entry highlighted below ('Use hardware graphics adapters for all Remote Desktop Services sessions') Right click the entry and select 'Edit' In the dialog, change the policy setting to 'Disabled' and click 'OK' Reboot the computer Background In recent Windows versions, the RDP service can use video and graphic hardware acceleration for 2D and 3D composition of remote session desktops, in latest versions it can even use H.264 video instead of GDI instructions for delivering the desktop to the client. When these RDP features are activated and a client connects via Remote Desktop, the RDP Session Host will block all D3D and DXGI for any other use than the local session. Under these circumstances, and when Emby Server is running in a local session and this session is not the one being logged into via RDP, it can happen that D3D9 based hardware accelerations are still working (sometimes with flaws, though), because D3D9 is always related to a user session context. Hardware acceleration based on D3D11 will never work in the described situation.

    "keywords": "Atmos on LG TV Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? by rbjtech Why does the Emby App for my LG TV not play the Dolby Atmos TrueHD Audio without Transcoding? Background There are two primary types of Audio that can be played with Media files � Compressed Audio (ie AC3/AAC/DTS Core etc) and Uncompressed (or HD) Audio (ie True-HD, DTS-HD etc) Compressed Audio uses a lot less data (bitrate) and thus is used for streaming services such as Netflix while HD Uncompressed Audio is the primary audio on �physical� media such as Blu-Ray or Ultra HD Blu-Ray disks because they have much more capacity to store the data. �Rips� of this physical media may contain the HD Audio streams, the result is a technical scenario that was outside the scope of the original LG architecture design. Where does Atmos come in? Dolby Atmos is a technology where the sound is given additional data to allow it to use extra positional speakers that you may have as part of your AV Sound setup. Generally, these are �height� speakers that give you the full 360 degrees experience. Atmos data can be applied to both Compressed Audio (in the form of Dolby Digital PLUS � EAC3) and HD Audio in the form of True-HD (THD). How can I get Emby to play Atmos using my Sound Bar or AV Receiver? As most people connected their DVD/Blu-Ray Player directly to the TV itself, a standard called ARC (Audio Return Channel) was introduced to pass the Audio back FROM the TV to the external amplifier. This was originally via Optical or Co-Ax cable but these days it�s via HDMI. This was great for DD/DD+/DTS compressed sound, but it was never designed for uncompressed sound as the hardware was not available. Note Streaming services/Internal LG Emby Client will use the ARC interface to pass DD+ Atmos (compressed) to a soundbar or Receiver without issue. For HD Audio however, a new standard was introduced called �eARC� or Extended ARC. This only works over HDMI and importantly both the TV Hardware, TV Software/Firmware and Amplifier must all support eARC. This is where the LG problem lies On 2019 Models and later, the TV Hardware supports eARC but only from External Sources NOT the TV itself. As the Audio from the Emby LG Client is being generated �internally� in the TV, then the hardware to use eARC is simply not available. Unfortunately, no firmware update can ever fix this, as the physical hardware �link� is missing � a massive oversight from LG on even their newest 2020 TV�s. So in summary, you have two options to play HD Audio Dolby Atmos Option 1 If your LG TV is year 2019+ and has eARC, then you can pass the HD Audio to your Receiver or Soundbar by means of an External Player via the TV eARC HDMI Interface. Option 2 If your LG TV does not have eARC, then you can pass the HD Audio to your Receiver or Soundbar( ) directly by means of an External Player. Video only is then passed to the LG TV. No ARC or eARC is required. ( ) Note the soundbar/receiver must have an HDMI passthough interface. Connecting the LG TV directly to the ARC or eARC enabled Receiver/Soundbar will only work for compressed Audio (DD,DD+), it will not work for HD Audio without Emby transcoding the streams."

See other sections of the documentation for more information: Movie naming TV naming Music naming Subtitles Library Setup Page The configuration will display the media libraries you've configured and allow you to add, remove, rename or change the paths they're mapped to. A media library is a grouping of one or more physical folders on your file system. To get started, click the button to add a media library. Clicking the \"Add Media Library\" button will open a dialog to add a library. You'll have to specify a content type, enter a display name, and choose a path to the media. Content Type Choosing the right content type is important. See the above guide on media preparation for best practices for Movie, TV and Music sections. Use the unset content type if you'd like to add a media folder that mixes different content. Please note that support for mixed content is limited. Initially you'll only be able to add one media path when setting up the library, but additional paths can be added after setting it up. Library Paths Each media folder can have one or more physical library paths. When you supply more than one media path, the contents of each will be merged together into one virtual display. To add a library path, click the + button. A popup will be displayed allowing you to browse to the location in a visual manner. Important If you are going to use one of the HTPC apps (Classic, Theater, or Kodi) it is very important to use the Optional Network Path feature to translate the server's local paths to network ones or define your media locations with network UNC paths that those machines can see. Warning If you have paths with more than 256 chars on Windows you may have a problem. Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation for help with this. Tip On some networks the visual browser may fail to display network devices. If this occurs you can still complete the dialog by typing in the path manually and clicking OK. Optional Network Paths By allowing Emby apps direct access to media folders on the server, they may be able to play them directly over the network and avoid using server resources to stream and transcode. Network Paths can help achieve this by mapping a path on the server to a network path that can be accessed by other devices. To learn more, see Optional Network Paths .

    "keywords": "Linux/Unix Permissions Excellent advice from user Q-Droid on the Emby Forums This is an excerpt from a community thread by a member who wanted to allow other applications and Linux users on their server to access the media structure used by Emby. The member wanted shared read and write access to the libraries which may contain files and directories owned by different users. Allow group of users (my-user,Emby,Kodi,etc.) to read and write media content. Allow same for SMB shares. Generally speaking you can't prevent Emby from following the rules of the OS and in Linux/UNIX these rules were created for security reasons. A \"line of code\" won't change that because only the superuser is allowed to change ownership at the user level. Emby doesn't run as superuser and you really don't want to do that anyway. So instead you work with the rules and tools for the OS. There are multiple ways to do this, I'll share what I would do. Need elevated rights for this, i.e. root. Identify your media base directory. Usually it's the common starting directory for your libraries. For example, if your libraries look like this: /mnt/library/movies /mnt/library/tv shows /mnt/library/music Then \"/mnt/library\" is your base. Servers with multiple storage volumes and external drives can have multiple paths to the libraries without a common base. If this is the case then modify each library path individually and pick a directory from which subdirectories will be created, but not \"/\" and not \"/mnt\". On the Emby server with the media to be shared, create a group for media if it doesn't exist. The group name is arbitrary though it helps to be descriptive: groupadd media Add members to the group (my-user, emby, etc.): usermod -a -G media my-user usermod -a -G media emby ... We'll use ACLs. First to set the permissions and then to set the defaults. It can be done in one command but it's easier to follow this way. Members of the media group will be able to access and modify files and directories under /mnt/library. New files and directories will be created with permissions for the media group. Set permissions for media group on existing items (the 'X' is upper case): setfacl -R -m g:media:rwX /mnt/library Define default permissions for media group. Applies to new items: setfacl -R -m d:g:media:rwX /mnt/library If you're using SMB/CIFS you can enforce similar rules. Assuming the users are the same and the group can be added. In smb.conf and for each of the shares add to current config: [share name] create mask = 0664 directory mask = 0775 force group = media The above should give you enough information to get started with minimal tweaking needed."

In most cases, Emby Server will automatically discover your HDHomerun on your network with no configuration required. You can manually add a tuner as well. Simply open the server dashboard, navigate to Live TV , then click Add underneath tuner devices. Add a TV Guide Data Source Out of the box, Emby Server currently supports the following TV Guide data sources: Emby Guide Data (United States, Canada and United Kingdom) Schedules Direct (Do not use on new setups. Will stop working June 1st, 2021) Xml TV Support for additional sources can be added by installing a Live TV Plugin . Match your Channel Lineup to Guide Data The final step of setting up Live TV is matching the tuner's stations to the Guide Data you have setup. Live TV Channel Mapping DVR Settings (optional) You can optionally change a few options used for DVR purposes. These options include: Amount of days of Guide Data loaded Default recording pathes Default Pre and Post recording padding times. This allows you set recording to start X minutes early and finish Y minutes late. DVR Settings Emby Live TV & DVR is Ready to Use. Congratulations, your Emby Server should now be configured properly and ready to use for Live TV and DVR."

    "keywords": "Live TV Channel Mapping . TODO: Complete Migration The last thing to do after setting up your tuner and guide data provider is to map your channel lineup. Emby tries to automate as much of the mapping as possible. What we are doing in this process is mapping a station id from our tuner lineup to the same station in our guide data. This is how Emby links the data to each station when presenting the EPG (Electronic Programming Guide) in the different Emby Client Applications. In this example we will start with the Emby Guide Data we setup in the tutorial. Click the 3 dots on the right side of the Data Provider and it will popup a small menu. This is also how you remove a guide provider but right now we are interested in mapping channels so we will click on Map Channels. If Emby is able to automatically map your channels it will look similar to above. Notice the top line is the channel reported by the Tuner. Underneath it is the channel data from the guide provider. Each of the above has a match. All we need to do is revew them to make sure they all matched correctly. Here is an example where Emby was not able to automatically match the tuner channel to the Guide Provier. Notice 28.2 GetTV and 28.3 Quest have no guide linked. To manually map a channel we click the pencil icon to the right of the channel. This brings up a list of channels that can be scrolled. To change the channel mapping click on the station in popup channel list. In this example we are editing the first station 3.1 KWY-TV. The check mark on the popup channel list conveniantly shows the currently selected mapping. We can change this by clicking any other channel. That is all there is to channel mapping. Note: In some cases you may find channels missing from the guide. This can happen especially with OTA guide data. Often times if you are close to market boundaries you may have to add a 2nd guide using a different postal code. If you are fortunate enough to be able to pickup channels from separate broadcast markets this will almost all be the case (need for additional guide data provider). Sometime you may need to try a different postal code closer to the broadcast towers. Don’t be afraid to try a few postal codes to get the guide data you need. In the event you’re setting up a cable provider and find missing channels, please report this to your provider. In the case of Emby Guide Data, please report this in the forums."

    "href": "support/articles/Metadata-manager.html",
    "title": "Metadata Manager | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "Metadata Manager One of the areas in which MediaBrowser shines as a media server is the metadata management. The server has a metadata manager which allows you to view all of the metadata for every item in your library in one place. The metadata manager can be accessed via the slideout in the web client in the top left hand corner of the screen. Another way to access the metadata manager is via Options -> Edit of the item you would like to edit. This method will take you directly to the item in the editor. Using the Metadata Manager Refreshing metadata Each media item has the option to Refresh itself. Selecting refresh will pull fresh metadata from each of the databases that the server is configured to pull from. In addition, it will download any images that may be missing (logos, disc images, posters, etc.). If you select the Advanced refresh button, you will get a popup with several options for what should be refreshed. The Metadata refresh mode options will only affect the text metadata. Refreshing all data (the default option) will overwrite all of the fields with metadata from outside databases. Refreshing only missing data will preserve all of the existing metadata and only populate the fields that are missing metadata. A local refresh will make the server reread the NFO or XML file that contains the metadata. Selecting None will not refresh any of the metadata. The Image refresh mode options will only affect the images that the server uses. Download only missing images (the default option) will only download images that are missing from the existing image collection. Download and replace images will force the server to redownload all of the images for the media item. Selecting None will prevent the server from changing any of the existing images and keep it from downloading more. Identifying items All media can get their information from online databases such as TheMovieDB and TheTVDB. If an item is misidentified by the server, you can manually identify the item using the Identify button, or, if you already know the database IDs for your incorrectly identified item, simply insert the correct IDs into the database fields and refresh the item. Database IDs Database IDs are extremely important to the server to determine what each media item is and whether it has been watched. One catch to this approach is that media items with the same IDs (for example, a movie that has both a 3D and 2D version) will be treated by the server as the exact same item regardless of the existence of two separate files. This can mean that it can show up in the Resume tab or other places twice. Also, if you watch the 3D version but not the 2D version, the server will mark both formats as watched. Saving metadata Be sure to hit Save after changing ANY metadata; otherwise, all of your changes will be lost when you navigate away from the page. If you wish for the changes that you made to be persistent through a refresh of the item, you will need to either lock the metadata field you changed, or lock the entire item. Parental Controls and Metadata You should be aware that there are certain metadata fields that affect the use of parental controls. One good example of such a metadata field is the parental rating. The parental rating can be used to set whether a server user can access content that is above a certain rating, e.g. allowing a teen to access content rated PG-13 or below while restricting access to content rated at R or above. Another metadata item that you can use to prevent a user from accessing certain content is the Tags metadata field. To keep a user profile from accessing certain content Tag each item that you want to prevent access to with a unique tag. Go to the Users -> Parental Control in the server dashboard. Add the unique tag to the Block content with these tags field. Save the changes to the user profile and media tags. To make sure the tags don't disappear in a library refresh, lock the Tags field in the item's metadata. Tip Tags can also be used for custom Cinema Intro trailers. Simply add a tag to each movie/episode such as \"HomeMovies\". Then you configure a path in Custom Intros for a Custom Codecs directory and add a movie with a tag (done externally) of \"HomeMovies\". This allows Emby to display your custom Intro for any movie tagged with the same name. Subtitles For your movies and TV shows, the metadata manager is the place to manage subtitles . You can see which subtitles you have, whether they are graphical or text, and what languages the subtitles are in. To enable access to the OpenSubtitles database, you will need to enter your account information in Metadata -> Subtitles in the dashboard. This area is also the place to manage what will be automatically downloaded when the Download missing subtitles task in Advanced -> Scheduled tasks is run. Images MediaBrowser can automatically download images to improve the presentation of media in each client. To enable automatic image downloading, you will need to have the Download artwork and metadata from the internet option checked in Metadata -> Basics in the dashboard. Images are downloaded from Fanart.tv, TheMovieDB, The Open Movie Database, and TheTVDB. The images tab in the metadata manager can be used to modify what images the server presents for your MediaBrowser clients. To change the image used, simply click on the cloud underneath each image and the server will search all of the databases for new images. Images can be edited using our image editing feature."

    "href": "support/articles/Movie-Naming.html",
    "title": "Movie Naming | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "Movie Naming This file naming guide applies to movies, home videos and music videos. For tv episode naming, see TV naming . Library Setup When setting up the library, make sure to select Movies , Home videos , or Music videos as the content type. Emby supports several different formats and naming conventions such as ISO copies of discs to DVD/Blu-Ray file formatted layouts which are both different types of disc copies. These formats work but are not an ideal way to build your library. Since neither of these are streaming formats they require more work by the server to transcode and stream to client apps. These formats and naming conventions are covered below. A much better way of building a large Emby library of content is to prepare you media ahead of time using a streaming friendly format such as MP4 or MKV containers featuring H.264 (or H.265) video with at least one 2 Channel AAC default audio track along side any other audio tracks such as Dolby Digital or DTS. Media prepared in this fashion will have the greatest compatibility with all Emby clients. The idea behind preparing your media ahead of time in this fashion is to reduce the need for the Server to have to transcode (convert) media on the fly. This is not a requirement but is strongly encouraged. Naming your media Once you've prepared your media files, it's time to name your media in a way that allows Emby the best chance of determining what it is. The best way to do this is to use the format: \"MovieName (year).extension\" such as \"Top Gun (1986).mp4\" or \"Avatar (2009).mkv\". Because Emby allows many other advanced functions that can be used with your media we want to create a folder structure that aids in this use. The simplest method of doing this is to put all media related to a Movie in the same folder using a name \"MovieName (year). Emby will then use the folder name to determine the movie. It will look like this: \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009).mkv \\Movies\\Pulp Fiction (1994)\\Pulp Fiction (1994).mp4 \\Movies\\Reservoir Dogs (1992)\\Reservoir Dogs (1992).mp4 \\Movies\\The Usual Suspects (1995)\\The Usual Suspects (1995).mkv \\Movies\\Top Gun (1986)\\Top Gun (1986).mp4 Complex Folder Structure If you plan on having thousands of movies in your library you may want to add an additional folder to your hierarchy to aid in navigation. For example you could create folders for all movies starting with the first letter or number such as: \\Movies\\A\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009).mkv \\Movies\\P\\Pulp Fiction (1994)\\Pulp Fiction (1994).mp4 \\Movies\\R\\Reservoir Dogs (1992)\\Reservoir Dogs (1992).mp4 \\Movies\\T\\The Usual Suspects (1995)\\The Usual Suspects (1995).mkv \\Movies\\T\\Top Gun (1986)\\Top Gun (1986).mp4 When viewing your media outside of Emby using conventional tools such as Windows Explorer this allows you to navigate your library much quicker without having to wait for thousands of folders to load. It saves you from scrolling through thousands of folders to get to your \"W\" movies for example. Emby will work just fine with or without this additional folder! ID Tags in Folder & File Names Emby can also read a Meta-Data ID from the name. Format: Name (Year) [tmdbid=xxxx] Example: Alone (2020) [tmdbid=509635] Emby supports the following tags with the host website for lookup. tmdbid ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) imdbid ( https://www.imdb.com/ ) tvdbid ( https://thetvdb.com/ ) Note: tmdbid is the prefered tag to use for most uses Multi-version movies Multiple versions of the same content can be stored in a single movie folder. /Movies /300 (2006) /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 1080p.mkv /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 4K.mkv /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 720p.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - extended edition.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - directors cut.mp4 /300 (2006)/300 (2006) - 3D.hsbs.mp4 Each version must begin with the folder name, followed by \" - \". If using the dash method anything following the dash will be what you see in the Emby client app. Note The above example includes a 3D version, which is discussed in the 3D Video naming guide. Also, this feature is primarily designed for multiple qualities of the same item. It can be used for different \"cuts\" but there may be some limitations in doing that. Movie extras Special features for movies can be stored as video files in an extras folder under movie folders. Nested folders are not supported. In addition to extras, several other sub-folder names are supported: extras specials shorts scenes featurettes behind the scenes deleted scenes interviews trailers /Movies /Home Alone (1990) Home Alone (1990).mkv /extras deleted-scenes.mkv /behind the scenes video1.mkv /interviews video1.mkv Note : Be sure the movie file is present before adding these additional \"extras\" to avoid mis-identification. Video images Images are supported in video folders. Below is a table of the supported image file names. Supported image extensions are jpg , jpeg , png , gif and tbn . Several image types support multiple file names. They are listed in the order that they're checked for. Image Type Supported file names Primary {name}.ext {name}-poster.ext {name}-cover.ext {name}-default.ext {name}-movie.ext folder.ext poster.ext cover.ext default.ext movie.ext Art {name}-clearart.ext clearart.ext Backdrop backdrop.ext, backdropX.ext fanart.ext, fanart-X.ext background.ext, background-X.ext art.ext, art-X.ext extrafanart (subfolder)/fanartX.ext Banner {name}-banner.ext banner.ext Disc {name}-disc.ext {name}-cdart.ext disc.ext cdart.ext Logo {name}-logo.ext logo.ext Thumb {name}-thumb.ext {name}-landscape.ext thumb.ext landscape.ext {name} represents the video file name, without extension. For videos that are not contained within their own folder, only the conventions using {name} are supported. For backdrops, X represents a number, and you can have any amount of numbered backdrops. For example: \\Movies \\300 (2006) backdrop.ext backdrop1.ext backdrop2.ext backdrop3.ext DVD and Blu-ray file formats Dvd and Blu-ray folder structures are also supported. To be recognized as a dvd structure, the folder must contain either a VIDEO_TS subfolder, or a VIDEO_TS.ifo file. To be recognized as a blu-ray structure, the folder must contain a BDMV subfolder. \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\VIDEO_TS.IFO Or: \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\VIDEO_TS\\VIDEO_TS.IFO ISO format Emby Server has basic support for videos stored in ISO format. This includes the ability to catalog the ISO's within Emby Server, and play them in HTPC-based apps such as Emby for Kodi and Emby for Windows Media Center. Other apps will generally only be able to play them with the use of an external player. ISOs should be named just like any other video file, with one minor difference. Including \".dvd\" or \".bluray\" within the file name will allow Emby Server to automatically determine what type of ISO it is. If this is not included, it will be assumed to be DVD. \\Movies\\Alien (1979)\\Alien (1979).dvd.iso \\Movies\\Léon (1994)\\Léon (1994).bluray.iso \\Movies\\Scarface (1983)\\Scarface (1983).iso Split video files (file stacking) The following are default stacking extensions that can be added to file names. # can be 1 through 9 or A through D. Stacking is supported for video files (but only when each video is in its own folder as in the example below) as well as dvd and blu-ray folder structures. Split videos require all parts be in the same movie folder with no other videos present in that folder. ​part#​ ​cd#​ ​dvd#​ ​pt#​ ​disk#​ ​disc#​ You can also use: moviename#.ext Where # can be A through D. Examples: \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009)-cd1.mkv \\Movies\\Avatar (2009)\\Avatar (2009)-cd2.mkv 3D videos 3D video files are supported. See 3D videos . Media stubs Media stubs are supported.

    "keywords": "Music Naming Emby is completely tag based which means all information is read from the tags embedded in your music tracks. Folder structure in Emby 4.6 and later versions is not mandatory but can be a useful way to organize you media. The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\\Album\\Song \\Music \\Artist Name \\Album Name 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 This is not a requirement and other structures will also work, but this is the most common method. Some other examples of supported structures are Album\\Song: \\Music \\Album Name 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 Or even a flat library of song files: \\Music 1- Song.mp3 2- Song.mp3 Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable. Track numbers are retrieved using embedded ID3 tag information. Your first step in setting up a music library is to select your folder structure. Either of the perfectly organized structures will allow for existing disc-based images to be used. Note Emby Server supports any folder structure for music libraries, but if you wish to save metadata files directly into your media folders such as nfo, images, etc, then then a structured folder layout is necessary to help Emby Server understand which folders correspond to your albums and artists. Emby Server will happily read these metadata files from the directories in your media or from the global metadata area it manages. If it's important to you to have these files written and stored next to your media, make sure to use one of the perfectly organized options above in the dropdown, preferably the artist\\album option in the middle. What you choose in the dropdown needs to match the layout on disk. Having a hierarchy of both artists and albums provides the most flexible and organized solution. Music Images Images are supported in both artist and album folders, as well as images embedded within audio files. Below is a table of the supported image file names: Supported image extensions are jpg , jpeg , png and tbn . Several image types support multiple file names. They are listed in the order that they're checked for. Image Type Supported file names Primary folder.ext poster.ext cover.ext default.ext Art clearart.ext Backdrop backdrop.ext, backdropX.ext fanart.ext, fanart-X.ext background.ext, background-X.ext art.ext, art-X.ext extrafanart (subfolder)/fanartX.ext Banner banner.ext Disc disc.ext cdart.ext Logo logo.ext Thumb thumb.ext landscape.ext For backdrops, X represents a number, and you can have any amount of numbered backdrops. For example: \\Music \\Artist Name backdrop.ext backdrop1.ext backdrop2.ext backdrop3.ext Tagging Your Tracks All music tracks should be tagged with whatever information you want displayed in Emby. Emby should support all common tags written by Musicbrainz Picard. Other common software used to alter/write tags is Mp3tag and Tagscanner. Please make sure to write all tag version or to remove old tags. All tags should be written using unicode format. Tagging your albums and tracks should be straightforward with the possible exception of various artist or compilation albums. For these types of compilation albums if you want all tracks to show up as a single entity you want to make sure both the \"album\" and \"album artist\" fields are the same for all tracks. Otherwise the album will be split up for the various artists listed. Multiple artists can be listed for tracks and should be separated with a \"; \" (semicolon space) as shown below. Note if you have an artist with two albums of the same name you will need to use mbzalbumids or slightly change one title to differentiate the albums or they will get combined. An example is artist Kim Wilde who has two albums name \"The Very Best Of Kim Wilde\", one from 1984, one from 2001. Music Videos To add music videos, setup a library with the type \"Music Videos\". The naming conventions for music videos are identical to movies . To identify the artists and albums of music videos, use the metadata manager . Simply edit a music video: Then enter the artist(s) and/or album: Once complete, the artist and album pages will display links to the music videos. Note You need to make sure your music files have been properly tagged using a 3rd party program. Emby uses these tags for identification. For Music videos you need to name these files the same as on the meta-data provider website which is https://imvdb.com/ Emby will use Album artwork that is local but will always pull down the Artist & People from the MetaData providers."

The first method is to have Emby use the date the file is scanned into the system. The second method is to have Emby use the date created time stamp of the media file itself. As an example if the current date is March 20th and you have media that was created on January 10th then there are two different dates that could be used depending on the setting you have set in Emby. If you use the date created, then once this new media is scanned into Emby it will be available but likely may not show up as \"new\" media since it will have a date added of Jan 10th. If you use the scan date, then Emby will ignore the creation date and will use the date added of the exact day it first sees the media added to the system which would be March 20th. In this case the media would show up as new. There are two different ways that people use Emby and half of the users want this to function one way while the other half want it to function the other way. Emby Server allows you to set this to function exactly how you want it to work. This can be useful for example if you setup a new library or server pointing to existing media. In this case you would likely want the system to use the media creation date during the initial library build. You could then change this to use the date scanned into the library after that by changing the option. You can set this by selecting Library on the left hand administrator menu, then selecting the \"Advanced\" menu option on the header in the right side up top. Don't forget to click the \"Save\" button after making any changes to this setting."

Network Paths are entered in UNC format and care should be taken to make sure the case (caps and lower case letters) are exact. Some devices will only mount and use a server name with all capital letters. This will require you to rename your file server and NAS boxes using all capital letters. Example: You have a Movies library on the server using C:\\Movies. This folder is also shared on the network with a share name of \"Movies-C\". The UNC format of this resource would then be similar to \\SERVER\\Movies-C Here are a few examples on a server name EMBYSERVER (using all caps in the name). There are multiple shares setup on this machine (one for each HDD). Note Please test your UNC path access outside of Emby to make sure apps and devices have proper access.

If you ever move you content around on disk after you have already created collections you will need to either rebuild those collections using the Web GUI or you can manually edit the individual text files that hold all collection info. This tutorial will cover how to manually edit your collection info. The files that hold collection information are stored in the “data\\collections” folder which is directly under your Emby Server folder. If on Windows it can look something like: C:\\Users\\SomeUserNameHere\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections An easy way to find this folder on ANY OS Emby runs on is to go to your Web Dashboard and scroll down the right side until you get to the PATHS section which will look something like this: If you look at either the LOGS or METADATA entries and remove the last part of the folder name you would have (in this example): C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\ Add “data\\collections” to the end of that line to arrive at: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\collections This folder will contain our list of collections which will look something like this: Each of these folders represents one collection. If we enter a folder such as the 300 Collection shown above we will have a few files that will look similar to this. You can see we have some fanart and a poster as well as the collection.xml file which will hold the information we plan to edit. You can edit this with any text edit such as NotePad or Notepad++. We’ll use Windows Notepad in this example. Once opened in Notepad we’ve scrolled down to the bottom of the file where the paths are located. You can see in this collection there are 3 files. Two normal videos and one 3D version. The paths are: F:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 F:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 F:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 Assuming we have moved all of our 3D movies to Drive G and moved our normal moves (first two) to drive M we would have: M:\\Movies#\\300 (2006)\\300 (2006).mp4 M:\\Movies#\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014)\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).mp4 G:\\3D Movies\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS\\300- Rise of an Empire (2014).3D.Half-SBS.mp4 All we need to do is edit the PATHS show above in Notepad so it looks like this: Save your changes in Notepad and repeat for the next collection you need to change. Note Please make sure the paths you use exactly match the way you set your library up. If for example you setup your library using: \"D:\\movies\" but your current playlists have \"\\server\\movies\" this will not work. Make sure you are consistent and use either drive letters or UNC style paths for both the libraries and the collections. When you are finished editing your collections, please run a library update by clicking the \"Scan All Libraries\" button at the top of the Library menu page. Playlists can be migrated the same way as collections. See this article for assistance with playlist migration."

All of the standard Emby Premiere membership options are designed for single-household use and carry with them a limit of 25 devices supported for Emby Premiere features. In our experience over a number of years, this standard license is sufficient for 95%+ of our users. If, however, you have a need to support more devices than this we do have several extended device options for you to choose from. The Emby configuration dashboard will warn you if you are close to or over your device limit so the best thing to do is just wait for that to show you are close and then choose a larger option if desired. Important points to remember: Very few users actually require more device support than the standard license. The limit applies only to Emby Premiere features so only apps that utilize those features will count towards the limit. The limit is a device limit NOT a concurrent connection limit. Each of your devices will need access to the internet and, specifically, mb3admin.com in order to validate the limit. The limit is tied to an Emby Premiere key, not a server so, if your key is in use on more than one server, then the limit will apply across all of them cumulatively. So how do I determine if the limit will be okay for me? Look at the Feature Matrix and note the features you use that are NOT in the \"Free\" column. Count the number of devices your users will use for just those features. Even if this count is near the 25 limit, we suggest you just try the normal license for a month of typical usage by your users and see if it works for you (it does for almost everyone). Your server will show if you are close to or over the limit. How long does a device count towards my limit? The system tracks device usage for about a week. So you need to count only devices used regularly by your users when estimating the limit for you. It is important to understand this is a device access limit NOT a concurrent connection limit. How do I \"knock\" a device off the list? You can't. The system tracks this automatically. Note, the devices you see listed in the \"Devices\" section of your dashboard are not your Premiere devices. Premiere devices are tracked by key, not by server and only if they use Premiere features. Why can't I see which devices are counted in my limit? The main reason we do not provide a way to do this at this time is security and privacy. To allow your server to see this exact information would require us to expose a public API that provides this information. Since we do not require you to have an account with us in order to use Premiere, there is no way for us to secure this API in a way that we are comfortable enough with to expose it. We are working on ways we may be able to do this in the future. Does my server (or servers) count as a device? No. Only apps that use a Premiere-only feature count. Can I \"stack\" licenses to get more devices? No. The licenses are only for the number of devices they indicate. The 45 device upgrade is for 45 devices exactly, not 45 additional devices. Can I buy more than one Premiere key? Yes, but you must use a different email address for each key. Since we don't require you to have an account, the email address is all we have to identify you and your key by so you cannot have two on the same email."

We wanted to provide you with the convenience of accessing Emby Premiere from directly within our apps and some of the store terms require us to do so as well. However, this does come at a cost since those store platforms take a significant commission on each sale (most are 30%+) so we are forced to have different pricing with these methods. Additionally, some platforms won't allow us to choose an exact price so we are forced into a certain \"tier\". You can always cancel your subscription created within the store app and then re-subscribe via the web site if you wish."

PayPal - On the Emby Media web site you select the option you wish to purchase and click the \"Checkout with PayPal\" button. This will take you to a PayPal login form where you can complete the purchase process. If you purchase a monthly subscription, the recurring payments will be completely under your control from within your own PayPal account (recurring payments section). When using PayPal, your key will be sent to the primary email address associated with the PayPal account. Since we don't require you to have an account with us, this is the email we are given by PayPal with the transaction. Direct Credit Card Payment - On the Emby Media web site you select the option you wish to purchase and click the \"Pay with card\" button. This will produce a form where you will need to provide a valid email address (very important as this is how you will receive your key) and your credit card information. This form is completely secure and none of your credit card information is ever passed through or stored on our servers. If you purchase a monthly subscription using this method, then your Emby Server configuration dashboard will have the option to initiate a cancellation process (via email confirmation) if you ever wish to cancel. Within an app - Some Emby apps will allow you the option to purchase a monthly subscription from right within that app. If you use this option, you will manage your subscription through the normal mechanisms of the account for that particular device (e.g. iTunes, Amazon or Google account). Some of these options may have additional charges due to the costs of the platform involved.

    "keywords": "Quick Start Emby has two distinct parts: Server — Store your media library in a central place Client — Clients or Apps that play back media from the Emby Server A fully-functioning Emby system requires both a Server and at least one client player. The Server includes the Emby web app which is used to manage the Server and your media library. It also features a media player, thus the minimal installation of just the server is enough to get started, but most people will want to install Emby apps on other devices for expanded client functionality. Has someone invited you to their server? If you have received an invitation to share an existing Emby server, then you can skip the server installation process and jump straight to app installation. The server is only required by people wanting to host their own media collection. Choose one of the many apps we have available: http://emby.media/download/ Or try the online web app, using the login credentials supplied by your Emby server administrator, at http://app.emby.media Prepare your media Emby identifies your media according to folder structure, file name, and type of library to which it is assigned. Once identified, Emby downloads a rich assortment of information about your media including ratings, cast, descriptions & poster art. It can often provide other content media such as movie trailers. The combination of this information creates a very rich client experience. The requirements for organizing and naming files are quite flexible, but will require some basic structure. The general recommendations are: Separate media into appropriate folders (e.g., Movies in a \"Movies\" folder, TV shows in a \"TV Shows\" folder, music in a \"Music\" folder, photos in a \"Photos\" folder, etc.) This is covered in detail in later sections. Movies should be named as \"Name (Year).ext\", for example \"Brave (2012).mp4\" TV shows should include season and episode numbers in the name, and be stored in separate folders per show. For example: \"\\TV\\Homeland\\Season 01\\Homeland s01e01.mp4\" Music should be stored within artist and album folders, such as \"\\Music\\Artist\\Album\\tracks\" Install the Server Once your media is named and organized, it's time to install the Server. The server is available on a number of platforms ranging from Windows to Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, NAS devices as well as media devices such as the Nvidia Shield TV. For more information, see installation . Install apps on your devices Once your installation is up and running and you've completed the startup wizard, it's time to install apps on your devices.

    "keywords": "Remote Setup . TODO: This is partially identical to Advanced Menu and Connectivity External Connections Emby Server allows you to optionally connect outside your home network. Before we begin, make sure you can connect to your Emby Server properly with apps and devices on your local network. If you have any issues with connections in your network check out local connectivity article. Turn on Remote Access The first step is to enable remote access. You do this from the Server's Network menu by enabling \"Allow remote connections to this Emby Server\". On the same page down below this section you will see these options: If you have a router that support UPnP and have this turned on you can enable the \"Enable automatic port mapping\" feature. If you do not see this option please install the Port Mapper Plugin from the plugin catalog. Note Most routers have the UPnP option turned off by default. If you turn on automatic port mapping in Emby Server (option shown above) and enable UPnP on your router you likely are done and Emby will work remotely! Note If you just enabled UPnP on your router, please restart Emby Server. Setup Port Forwarding If you're unable to connect after testing the above settings with automatic port mapping, then you may need to setup port forwarding manually with your router to allow external connectivity to your Emby Server. To do this, turn off the \"Enable automatic port forwarding\" option just set and open the web interface for your router. You will need to forward TCP Port 8096 on your router to port 8096 on the Emby Server machine. Do the same for port 8920 as well (if using SSL). The process of doing this will be slightly different for each router model. Here is a good step by step guide on how to do this: http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router This Youtube video also explains it pretty well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-R-eHiQco Here is an example router setup showing 2 ports forwarded: Locate Your External Address Your external address is displayed on the front page of the server dashboard, labeled as Remote access. This is the address you should use when away from home. Test Your External Address The easiest way to test your external address, is to open it in a web browser while away from home, or inside your home using a smart phone with the WIFI connection turned off. Important Testing your external address inside your home might not work, and this is OK. Some internet routers disable loopback capabilities (going out and coming back in), therefore you might not be able to test this from inside your home network. It's important that you test away from home, or with your smart phone's wifi connection turned off. If the external address works in a browser, then you're good to go, and can proceed with connecting from Emby apps. If this doesn't work continue with how to verify your public IP and port. Verify Public IP and Port To test these open a browser and visit canyouseeme.org . The IP you see listed here must match what Emby shows on the dashboard. If it doesn't remote access will not work and likely your ISP is using CG-NAT and you are blocked from running services. In this case visit our forums for assistance. If the IP address matches the next step is to enter the PORT (8096 or 8920) to test on canyouseeme.org . If it succeeds your Emby Server should be working remotely. If this test fails you should re-check the setup mentioned above. If you have any issues please visit our forums for assistance. If this doesn't work you will want to try completely disabling (turn off) any local malware & firewall software running on the same host temporarily to see if they may be blocking Emby. If you have a VPN running on the host computer TURN THIS OFF as that may interfere with your Emby Server routing. You could also be blocked by your ISP in something known as a cgNAT (carrier grade Network Address Translation). One way of spotting this is to open a command prompt and doing a trace route to 8.8.8.8. On windows it would be: tracert 8.8.8.8 Ignore the first line which will be your own router. What you want to see is if any of the next 3 or 4 lines start with 10., 192. or 172. If the first number is a 172 we need to check the second number to see if it's between 16 to 31. If any of these returned lines matches this you are likely being blocked by your ISP."

If you have an older model that is not capable of running that firmware version, our old app may still work for you. It can be downloaded as a zip file from the old repository. Emby for Roku can handle just about any type of media thanks to Emby Server transcoding . If you would like to learn how to prepare your media for Direct Play, read below. Setup Guide A setup guide is available in the Emby Community . Direct Play Media Formats Video — H.264/AVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV), on Roku 4 only: H.265/HEVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); VP9 (.MKV) Subtitles - SRT and other text-based formats Audio – AAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); MP3(.MP3, .MKV); WMA (.ASF, .WMA, .MKV), FLAC (.FLAC, .MKV), PCM (.WAV, .MKV, .MP4, .MOV), AC3/EAC3 (.MKV,.MP4. .MOV, .AC3), DTS (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV), ALAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV, .M4A) Image — JPG, PNG, GIF (non-animated) Multichannel AAC is not supported on all Roku models. Roku TV’s and Roku 4 set-top-boxes do support multichannel decode to PCM stereo. On Roku set-top-boxes Dolby Digital audio (AC3, EAC3) is only supported via pass through. DTS is only supported via pass through on both Roku set-top-boxes and Roku TV’s. You must connect your Roku player via HDMI or S/PDIF to a TV or receiver capable of decoding Dolby Digital or DTS in order to hear videos with audio tracks in those formats. Best Practices for Direct Play Ensure your media meets the above criteria. Configure your audio settings in the Roku device control panel. If you'd like DTS audio to passthrough, you'll need to make sure your Roku is configured correctly, or it may trigger transcoding. Compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

It is also useful to provide required secured streams to external services such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. If you are interested in an even more secure setup, here is a community-written guide on HOW TO: NGINX Reverse Proxy . You'll need two things: A domain that supports TXT records A ssl certificate (PKCS #12) Get your domain Sign up for a free domain of your choice. You could use Freenom or Dynu . SSL certificate We will now create Let's encrypt ssl certificates and add it to your domain. Here is a free service to help with this SSL for free . Enter your domain on the site. i.e. yourdomain.com and create a free SSL certificate Select Manual Verification (DNS) > Manually verify domain. We now have 2 TXT records (step 2 on the SSL for free website). We will copy back the TXT records to the domain provider. Leave the SSL for free page open. We will come back to it. On the domain provider website, select your domain > Manage DNS. Let's create a new TX record. Repeat the steps for both TXT records on SSL for free. Your information should look like this. Name : _acme-challenge.{yourdomain.com} Type : TXT. TTL : 300 (if you can set it to 1, go for it). Target : qariKbGVafpb5MespqHdMaGi933yW-Z2A3shE0wIyZA You'll notice Type A records in the same section. You can remove the WWW entry. Ensure your external IP is correct. If you have a dynamic IP, you'll need to keep this updated when it changes. Wait about 15 minutes. Let the domain name and changes propagate. Back to the SSL for free website. Look at step 3, you'll see a link or two to click. Click them. If it is successful, go ahead and click Download SSL certificate. If it is not successful, wait a little longer and retry. Setup Emby with your domain and SSL certificate Now you should have a domain and a folder of ssl certificate (ca_bundle.crt, certificate.crt, private.key). We are almost done. Your Emby server requires a PKCS #12 certificate (certificate.crt and private.key combined). Use this online certificate converter . Select type to convert to: PKCS #12. This should expand the number of fields. Once completed, you'll get a new .pfx certificate. Certificate file : certificate.crt Private key : private.key Chain certificate : The ca_bundle.crt or you can also find it here, Let's Encrypt Intermediate certificate . Save the text into a .txt file. PFX password : Since the private key is combined with the certificate, set a password to secure the new ssl certificate. Remember this password, you'll need it in Emby. Go to your Emby server dashboard > Advanced. Save your changes and restart your server. External domain : yourdomain.com Custom SSL certificate path : point to your new certificate.pem Certificate password : The password you set up in the previous step. Secure connection mode : Set it to Preferred but not required or Required for all remote connections. Your dashboard should now reflect your remote access as https://yourdomain.com:port . If you followed all the steps, clicking the new remote url should reach your Emby server. If it doesn't work, verify your https ports and try connecting from outside of your network. Save all your certificate files and keys in safe location. You'll need the private key when you are ready to renew your SSL certificate (I have my own CSR option on SSL for free). Since this is all for free, it requires a bit more involvement. You will need to ensure you renew your SSL certificates (every 3 months with SSL for free) and your free domain (every year at least). If you used SSL for free, I suggest creating an account to make the renewal process easier."

    "keywords": "Sync Introduction . TODO - Complete migration The sync feature allows you to make use of content without playing it back directly from the Emby Server. It's a unique feature with many practical uses. With Emby Sync, you can choose specific media, then a device or destination such as a cloud provider along with criteria such as resolution and bit rate and Emby will prepare/convert the media to the format requested, then copy it to the destination. There are a few different types of sync built into Emby. Some of these sync types are only available to the administrator for setup while other types can be used by users of the Emby server (if given permission). As an example, an administrator can setup Dropbox or Google Drive as a sync destination, then setup specific media to be synced to the \"cloud\". This is quite useful when the administrator's Emby Server is ran from a location with limited upload bit rate. In this way the administrator can SYNC popular or new movies/shows to the cloud. Then when a remote user plays back this media the Emby server instructs the Emby client to play back the media from the cloud location instead of using the server's upload bandwidth. In this scenario the media is prepared and uploaded ONE TIME to the cloud where it can then be played back from numerous times without requiring the server to use bandwidth delivering the file again and again. Another popular way to use SYNC is by an individual user who has been given access to the sync feature. In this case typically the user will pick a few movies or TV Shows and sync this content to a mobile device. This allows them to then playback this media \"off line\" without the need to communicate with the Emby server. This is an excellent way of allowing the family to load up on media to take on vacation, to give you kids something to watch on long car drives, to catch up on shows during lunch at work or to enjoy on public transportation getting to work. While these are two completely different uses of Emby Sync (there are others as well) what they have in common is that the original media is not touched in any way. All media always resides on the Emby Server. Syncing does not \"move\" or \"relocate\" media in any way and will continue to be available for all other users just as it normally is. Emby Sync is very flexible and can provide different features for different needs. It will be best to explore the functionality first hand and visit the forums for other unique uses of other types of syncing such as folder sync!"

We appreciate you being a part of the test team, however we make no promises of stability if you choose to use beta releases in your production environment. Details:- We currently have full Synology package support for beta releases of Emby Server, which are made available through a dedicated repository. The framework is in place to support development releases, but Mono development builds are not available at this time. If you want to access the beta package repository, please send me a PM @solabc16. This repository contains both stable and beta releases, to see the beta releases you will still need to tick the 'Yes, I want to see beta versions!' in Package Center's settings. Once you have installed a beta release, you will need to wait for a stable release with a version number that is the same or higher than the beta you have installed, before you can switch back to a stable release. The reason for not making the beta releases via the default package source is as follows:- Package Center's handling of beta channels is at best limited, which has been a long standing concern with regard to introducing beta and/or dev releases of Emby Server via this mechanism. The worst scenario for us, is 'end users' (i.e. not testers or developers) accidently installing or updating to a dev or beta release and suffering a poor experience as a result. There are many reasons why the 'beta' flag may be ticked and there are certainly some sites and package developers that require end users to do it, as they are not providing stable releases. This is not great scenario as it fails to recognise the global nature of the flag, however there is nothing we can do about that right now, so we've implemented an alternate approach. The repository 'https://synology.emby.media/' will only serve up stable builds, regardless of the beta flag's setting. This is the URL that will be in the public domain and thus make it impossible for 'end users' to end up with a dev or beta release on their systems. >> Back to Synology : Help and Support <<"

If you prepare you media in a format that all devices can use, such as MP4 container, using H.264 video with a stereo AAC audio track then you won't need a powerful server normally because all Emby apps can use that format directly. If however you don't prepare your media ahead of time like this or if you don't have adequate bandwidth between the client and server to play the media AS IS then the Emby Server will assist you by transcoding (converting) your media on the fly in real-time. Transcoding is the process where media is converted from one resolution or format to another (e.g. playing Full HD media on some smartphones requires transcoding). The process is CPU-intensive, so an older/slower PC might not be up to the task. Windows, Mac, Linux, or FreeBSD computer Minimum Requirements — no transcoding Intel Core 2 Duo processor 1.6 GHz or better At least 1GB RAM for Windows/Mac OS X At least 512MB RAM for Linux Windows: Vista or later OS X: MacOS 10.13 or later Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux Recommended Configuration — transcoding HD Content: Intel Core 2 Duo processor 2.4 GHz or better If transcoding for multiple devices, a faster CPU may be required At least 2GB RAM Windows: Vista or later OS X: MacOS 10.13 or later Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux Note Emby also supports Hardware Based Transcoding using a GPU/Video card (if new enough). This can substantially reduce the CPU requirements needed for multiple transcodes in real-time!

    "keywords": "Transcoding Emby has the ability to convert your media during playback in order to make it compatible with all of your devices. This process is known as transcoding. In most cases, the server and the apps will automatically select the ideal settings to achieve smooth playback. This is based on a variety of factors including network performance, media information, device capabilities, and various configuration settings. In some cases though, you may choose to provide your own configuration in order to improve the playback experience. App Settings Every Emby app will have a setting known as \"Max streaming bitrate\". This is the most important setting to configure within the app that you're trying to use, and will have the greatest effect on image quality. As you increase the bitrate quality will improve, but will require a faster connection between the device and server. Ineligible formats for transcode Dvd and Blu-ray ISOs 3D videos Server Settings In addition, the server has some transcoding settings that can be configured. These are found by opening the server dashboard and navigating to Transcoding . The hardware video decoder setting allows the use of the following options: Intel Quick Sync NVidia NVENC Open MAX (OMX) VAAPI NB. This is not an exhaustive list, so please choose the correct setting in the drop-down menu. This should only be enabled if you have the appropriate hardware and may result in errors otherwise. If you're unsure, leave the setting at Auto and the system will attempt to automatically detect this. The thread count setting allows you to specify how many processors to allocate to each transcoding job. In almost all cases, this should be left to Auto as the system will adapt based on current conditions. Temporary Path The server will need to create temporary files throughout the transcoding process. The location of these files can be configured. If you specify a custom path, please ensure the following conditions are met: The folder is writable The folder is not used for any other purpose, as the server will delete all contents to keep it clean. Audio Boost When surround audio is converted to 2-channel stereo audio, this often results in a lower volume level. To offset this, you can configure an audio boost scale factor to increase the volume. The default value is 2 , meaning the volume will be doubled when converting surround audio to stereo. Why Is My Media Transcoding? Whenever possible, Emby apps will play your files directly and avoid transcoding. Transcoding will only be used when files are not natively supported by the device you're trying to play from, or the bitrate of the content is higher than the app's bitrate setting. Why Is My File Transcoding? First, compare the media format of your file to the format supported by the Emby app. You can find the media info in the Emby Web Client, at the bottom of the detail page: If the file is not natively supported, transcoding will be required. Next, compare the bitrate of your file to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of your file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of the file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it. Emby apps are beginning to support automatic bitrate detection in order to automatically select the highest bitrate possible. Most users will see best results by leaving the bitrate setting on Auto. Lastly, are subtitles selected? If subtitles are selected, then this may trigger transcoding if the app does not natively support the subtitle format. Most Emby apps have native support for text-based subtitles (e.g. srt, vtt, etc). Graphical subtitles such as PGS and VobSub are more likely to trigger transcoding. To learn more about the formats that are natively supported by each Emby app, please visit the documentation section for that app: Amazon Fire TV Android Mobile Android TV Chromecast iOS Roku Web Client My Files Shouldn't Be Transcoding. How Do I Report This? Start by focusing on a single example. Please report this in our community: http://emby.media/community/ Please make sure to supply the following information: A copy of the media info from the web interface The Emby Server log from the time you played the content The Emby Server transcoding logs from the same time (if any). Logs can be accessed directly within the server's web interface by navigating to Help -> Logs ."

    "title": "TV Naming | Emby Documentation",
    "keywords": "TV Naming For a simple TV folder structure, the recommended folder layout is Series (year)\\Season #\\Episode. The Episode name itself should contain the show name, the season and the episode episode number which is covered below. When setting up the library make sure to select TV as the content type. Having the year in the series name is not strictly mandatory as Emby can usually match a series without it but it helps tremendously with rebooted series and those that have broadcast in different years such as Battlestar Galactica (1978) and Battlestar Galactica (2003). The year is also very helpful for some series such as Africa (2013) which could potentially match to a few different shows without the year. For example: \\TV \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 Glee S01E01.mp4 Glee S01E02.mp4 \\TV \\Seinfeld (1989) Seinfeld S01E01.mp4 Seinfeld S01E02.mp4 Complex Folder Structure In more complex situations where your top-level directory is further sub-divided before the show folders, the recommended option is to create a TV media folder and add the sub-folder locations instead of the top level folder. For example: \\TV \\A-M \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 Glee S01E01.mp4 \\N-Z \\Seinfeld (1989) \\Season 1 Seinfeld S01E01.mp4 In the above example, the recommended setup is to create a TV media folder, and then add the A-M and N-Z library paths. For more information on setting up the library, see Library Setup . DVD and Blu-ray episodes Dvd and Blu-ray folder structures are also supported. The folders can have any name, but using episode numbers will improve the ability to download and display metadata. To be recognized as a dvd structure, the folder must contain either a VIDEO_TS subfolder, or a VIDEO_TS.ifo file. To be recognized as a blu-ray structure, the folder must contain a BDMV subfolder. \\TV \\Glee (2009) \\Season 1 \\Glee S01E01-E04 \\VIDEO_TS \\Glee S01E05-E08 VIDEO_TS.IFO \\Glee S01E09-E10 \\BDMV Mixed Content Libraries TV series are supported in mixed content libraries using the Unset content type, but season sub-folders are required in this scenario. Episode naming conventions A number of naming conventions are supported: show name - S01E01 - Episode Name.ext show name S01E01 Episode Name.ext anything_s01e02.ext anything_s1e2.ext anything_s01.e02.ext anything_s01_e02.ext anything_1x02.ext anything_102.ext anything_1x02.ext 02 Episode Name.ext s01e02.ext 1x02.ext By date Common for long-running daily shows, you can also use the date the episode aired. anything_1996.11.14.ext anything_1996-11-14.ext anything_14.11.1996.ext Multi-Version Episodes Multi-Version Episodes are best using the following format: show name - S01E01 - Display Name 1.ext show name - S01E01 - Display Name 2.ext For example: Star Trek, The Next Generation - S01E01 - Original Broadcast.mkv Star Trek, The Next Generation - S01E01 - Digital Remix.mkv anything following the \"-\" (dash) up to the file extension will be used in the drop down version selector in your Emby client. In this case the two versions show in the interface will be \"Original Broadcast\" & \"Digital Remix\". Multi-Episode files All multi-episode files must be part of the same season. The following conventions are supported: 01x02x03 episode name.ext S01x02x03 episode name.ext S01E02E03 episode name.ext S01xE02xE03 episode name.ext S01E02-E03 episode name.ext S01E02-X03 episode name.ext 01x02 01x03 episode name.ext 01x02 - 01x03 episode name.ext 01x02 - 01x05 episode name.ext (includes episodes 2,3,4 and 5) 01x02 - x03 episode name.ext 01x02 - x05 episode name.ext S01x02.S01x03 episode name.ext S01x02 - S01x03 episode name.ext show name 01x02x03 episode name.ext show name S01x02x03 episode name.ext show name S01E02E03 episode name.ext show name S01xE02xE03 episode name.ext show name S01E02-E03 episode name.ext show name S01E02-E05 episode name.ext show name S01E02-X03 episode name.ext show name S01E02-X05 episode name.ext show name 01x02 01x03 episode name.ext show name 01x02 - 01x03 episode name.ext show name 01x02 - x03 episode name.ext show name S01x02.S01x03 episode name.ext show name S01x02 - S01x03 episode name.ext Specials Specials should be named using one of the following season folder names: Season 0 Season 00 Specials For example: \\TV \\Glee (2009) \\Season 0 Glee S00E01.mp4 Tip Please see Ordering TV Show Special/Extras to learn how to place these specials in the proper timeline. Series & Season Images Images are supported in both series and season folders. Below is a table of the supported image file names. Supported image extensions are jpg , jpeg , png and tbn . Several image types support multiple file names. They are listed in the order that they're checked for.

    "keywords": "Users Most operations within Emby are based around users. Users can have their own personalized media libraries, user data, recommendations, security settings, and more. Users are managed within the server dashboard by navigating to Users . Local Users Local users are displayed under the user heading. These are users that you've created in the server dashboard, and are privately managed within your personal Emby Server. The Emby Server setup wizard will create a user with administrative access. This screen allows administrators to add, edit and remove additional users. A local user will be displayed with a cloud if it is linked to Emby Connect . Linking a user to Emby Connect will enable an easier sign in process that doesn't require the user to know your server's ip address. For more information, see Emby Connect . Adding a User To add a user, click the + button within the Users heading: You'll then be taken to the new user page page. The only required field is a user name: In addition you can also configure library and channel access, and this can easily be changed later: Feature Access To manage user feature access, start by visiting the Users page and clicking on a user account. Any user can be granted administrative access which will allow them to utilize the server dashboard. Other features can also be granted or denied, such as the ability to delete media, sync media, view live tv, manage live tv, etc. The \"Allow media playback\" option determines if the user is able to play media or not. This option is handy if you'd like to setup a user who can browse the library but not play anything. You can also decide how they can remote control shared devices. Remote controlling another user allows them to send content to devices for playback while another user is signed in. Remote controlling shared devices, such as Dlna devices, allows them to send content to those as well. Lastly, advanced access will give you the ability to disable or hide a user, as well as lock them from changing their user profile settings. Disabling a user will do just that. All existing sessions from that user will be abruptly terminated. Hiding a user will simply remove them from visual login screens. They will need to enter their username and password manually. Disabling user preference access will prevent a user from changing their profile settings, such as their image, password, view preferences, language preferences, and more. This is useful for administrators who prefer to dictate these terms to their users. Content Access See Content Access . Device Access See Device Access . Parental Controls See Parental Controls . User Password See Passwords . Deleting a User To delete a user, simply click the dot menu button and select Delete:"

Setup Guide The Emby Web App is included with your installation of Emby Server. To access it just open a web browser and visit: http://{your server ip}:8086. Server Management The Emby Web App is a convenient place to manage all aspects of your Emby Server, including the Library Setup, Users, Plugins, and more. Chromecast and Remote Control The Emby Web App supports casting to Chromecast devices and other Emby apps. To connect to your Chromecast device, simply click the cast icon in the top right corner of the app. You'll then be asked which device you'd like to connect to. Once connected, any content you play will be sent to the Chromecast device. You're able to play individual files, entire folders, shuffle, instant mix, queue, and more. For more information, see Chromecast . Direct Play Media Formats The Emby Web app can direct play media to your browser when the browser supports the format natively. Please check your web browser of choice for it's supported media formats. Best Practices for Direct Play Leave the app's streaming bitrate setting on the default value of Auto, if possible. The app will perform bandwidth tests with your Emby Server to determine the maximum playable bitrate. If you are customizing the bitrate setting, then you will need to compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it."

Emby can dim the lights when you start a movie, or send a tweet after you finish watching an episode of your favorite TV show. A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Examples uses would be to setup Zapier or IFTTT and have the Emby webhooks feature connect to those applications. Once Zapier or IFTTT receives the notification, then you can configure it to perform certain actions based on that.
