{"conceptual":"\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Emby is completely tag based which means all information is read from the tags embedded in your music tracks. Folder structure in Emby 4.6 and later versions is not mandatory but can be a useful way to organize you media.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"10\">The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\\Album\\Song</p>\n<pre><code sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"12\"> \\Music\n    \\Artist Name\n       \\Album Name\n          1- Song.mp3\n          2- Song.mp3\n</code></pre>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"20\">This is not a requirement and other structures will also work, but this is the most common method. Some other examples of supported structures are Album\\Song:</p>\n<pre><code sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"22\"> \\Music\n    \\Album Name\n          1- Song.mp3\n          2- Song.mp3\n</code></pre>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"29\">Or even a flat library of song files:</p>\n<pre><code sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\"> \\Music\n    1- Song.mp3\n    2- Song.mp3\n</code></pre>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable.

Emby Server will happily read these metadata files from the directories in your media or from the global metadata area it manages.</p>\n</div>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">If it's important to you to have these files written and stored next to your media, make sure to use one of the perfectly organized options above in the dropdown, preferably the artist\\album option in the middle. What you choose in the dropdown needs to match the layout on disk. Having a hierarchy of both artists and albums provides the most flexible and organized solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"music-images\" sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">Music Images</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"55\">Images are supported in both artist and album folders, as well as images embedded within audio files.

Other common software used to alter/write tags is Mp3tag and Tagscanner.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"97\">Please make sure to write all tag version or to remove old tags. All tags should be written using unicode format.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"99\">Tagging your albums and tracks should be straightforward with the possible exception of various artist or compilation albums.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"103\">For these types of compilation albums if you want all tracks to show up as a single entity you want to make sure both the &quot;album&quot; and &quot;album artist&quot; fields are the same for all tracks. Otherwise the album will be split up for the various artists listed.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"107\">Multiple artists can be listed for tracks and should be separated with a &quot;; &quot; (semicolon space) as shown below.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"109\"><img src=\"~/content/support/articles/images/music-naming-multiple-artists.png\" sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"109\" alt=\"Music Naming Multiple Artists\"></p>\n<div class=\"NOTE\" sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"111\">\n<h5>Note</h5>\n<p sourcefile=\"content/support/articles/Music-Naming.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"112\">if you have an artist with two albums of the same name you will need to use mbzalbumids or slightly change one title to differentiate the albums or they will get combined.
